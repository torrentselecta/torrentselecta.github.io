00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:10,748
How was your meeting
with Helene?

2
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:12,645
To Villanelle.
The keeper.

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,588
She's moving up
in the world.

4
00:00:14,893 --> 00:00:17,282
You can't beat us.
You understand?

5
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:19,482
Are you working for them,
Paul?

6
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:21,428
Are YOU,
Carolyn?

7
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:24,299
- What did you want with my child?
- She kissed me!

8
00:00:24,384 --> 00:00:26,004
Geraldine kissed you?

9
00:00:26,096 --> 00:00:28,101
Irina.
Be ready.

10
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,505
Your plan to get out. I'm in.

11
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,229
- I'm done with it. I'm leaving.
- What do you mean, you're leaving?

12
00:00:35,313 --> 00:00:37,500
I don't want to do this anymore.

Villanelle.

17
00:01:12,585 --> 00:01:14,166
Finally.

18
00:01:17,628 --> 00:01:19,767
That guy was really staring
at me.

19
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,431
This is Rhian.

20
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:39,033
Nice collection.

21
00:01:39,426 --> 00:01:40,868
What are you doing?

22
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:42,847
Working out how I'd kill you.

23
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:45,439
I thought killing wasn't really
your thing at the moment.

24
00:01:45,524 --> 00:01:48,750
You want to test that theory?
You're only as good as your last.

25
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:54,170
Go on, tell me. How would you do it?

26
00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:58,595
I don't know yet, but it would
definitely involve the tiny chair.

27
00:02:05,123 --> 00:02:06,879
Sit down.

28
00:02:06,964 --> 00:02:08,164
Not on that one.

29
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:25,401
Show me. Your injury.

30
00:02:28,952 --> 00:02:30,100
Here.

31
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,320
Do you know
why I love you, Villanelle?

32
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,217
Because you're an agent of chaos.

33
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,394
And I love chaos.

34
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,467
Chaos disrupts.

35
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:05,156
It rips apart and starts again.

36
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:07,229
It's like a forest fire.

37
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,016
It burns. It clears.

38
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:12,544
It's monstrous, but it's beautiful.

39
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:37,801
You're a beautiful monster,
Villanelle.

40
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,636
A monster?

41
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,463
Monstrous people
like you often

42
00:03:42,548 --> 00:03:44,374
feel like
they have to fly solo,

43
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,556
like they have to keep things
bottled up inside them

44
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,436
thoughts, feelings... secrets.

45
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:56,845
And that can affect their ability
to be truly monstrous.

46
00:03:57,394 --> 00:04:00,444
Do you have anything you would like
to get off your chest, Villanelle?

47
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,360
Has something happened recently?

48
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,850
I did something bad
to my mother.

49
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,154
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

50
00:04:12,647 --> 00:04:15,038
I don't want us
to keep secrets from each other.

51
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,800
I took a shit in her shoe
when I was three.

52
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,811
A really big one.

53
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,385
Give me another job.

54
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,016
You're injured.

55
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,034
I'll take Dasha.

56
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,551
OK, but success is essential.

57
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:47,080
Otherwise, what's the point
of sending you and not Rhian?

58
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:51,440
Thank you
for the inappropriate touching.

59
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:54,341
It's actually pretty nice.

60
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,044
You wouldn't be able to, by the way.

61
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:02,669
Wouldn't be able to what?
Kill me before I killed you.

62
00:05:02,754 --> 00:05:05,830
You're a child. You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

63
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:07,443

It's just
standard white-person stuff.

79
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,065
I've been tracking him
for a week

80
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,549
and there's nothing to suggest
he's working for The Twelve,

81
00:06:16,634 --> 00:06:18,094
unless they've branched out into, uh,

82
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,791
groceries and hot vinyasa.

83
00:06:20,953 --> 00:06:24,229
Jokes are for people
who do their jobs correctly, Mo.

84
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:25,998
So are omelettes.

85
00:06:30,581 --> 00:06:32,502
- Do you want me to make up evidence?
- No!

86
00:06:32,587 --> 00:06:35,056
I want you to uncover
the evidence that already exists,

87
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:37,714
which you haven't
worked hard enough to expose.

88
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,141
Thank you.

89
00:06:42,323 --> 00:06:43,505
Thank you.

90
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,965
I know you're upset
about Kenny,

91
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,085
that we haven't found out
what happened to him.

92
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,763
Your powers of deduction
are incredible.

93
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,419
But are you sure
Paul's a member of The Twelve?

94
00:06:56,504 --> 00:06:59,382
A bottle of chablis,
a stir-fry kit and a bath bomb.

95
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:00,617
What does that say to you?

96
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:02,337
That he's planning
a lovely evening in?

97
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,417
Or that he's trying to seem
that he is.

98
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:09,033
Trust me. That vintage of chablis
is undrinkable.

99
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:12,537
Off you go.

100
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,386
Another young person inspired?

101
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,575
Don't complain.
I've saved you his omelette.

102
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:29,261
Villanelle
has been promoted.

103
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,003
Dasha told me as much.

104
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:32,689
That should be our focus for now.

105
00:07:32,774 --> 00:07:34,983
Oh, dear.
You don't deserve it after all.

106
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:41,097
Villanelle is rising up the ranks.

107
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:43,055
She is our best chance
of getting to them.

108
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,882
Oh, Eve,
what a blinkered approach.

109
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:46,768
Do you ever think
of anything else?

110
00:07:46,852 --> 00:07:48,300
Don't pretend that
I'm the only one.

111
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,137
You have your own thing going on
with Villanelle.

112
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:52,080
For all I know,
you have a direct line.

113
00:07:52,301 --> 00:07:54,177
Isn't it time you told me?

114
00:07:55,181 --> 00:07:57,577
What was it you said to her
in that prison?

115
00:07:58,402 --> 00:08:00,755
I offered her work and she refused.

116
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:02,082
Hmm.

117
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:04,336
Good for her.

118
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:07,270
Eve, I won't have
my investigation derailed

119
00:08:07,357 --> 00:08:09,385
by your undiagnosed,
and, frankly,

120
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,356
a little trying,
Messiah complex.

121
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:14,669
Wow. Wow. I'M the one
with the Messiah complex.

122
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:19,097
Carolyn, why did we start this,
any of it?

123
00:08:19,402 --> 00:08:21,545
Information,
intelligence gathering,

124
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:24,685
to compile
a comprehensive Filofax

125
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,666
of despots,
maniacs and extremists

126
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:29,177
in case we want to throw
a Christmas bash.

127
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:31,048
I mean, that's what we do,
isn't it?

128
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:33,576
No, it might have been once,
but not now.

129
00:08:33,884 --> 00:08:35,339
Not after
everything that's happened,

130
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:37,426
after everything we've lost.

131
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:39,912
Eve, you'd do well to remember...

132
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,931
...heroes only get the girl
in Hollywood.

133
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,500

Can we go now?

136
00:09:26,903 --> 00:09:28,739
Your daughter is extremely bright.

137
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:31,825
Believe me,
it's a nightmare.

138
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:35,390
Getting told "Go eat a dick"
in Icelandic!

139
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:38,179
She is also manipulative,
calculating.

140
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:42,313
- Almost entirely lacking in empathy.
- Like her mother.

141
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,537
When I ask her about the accident
involving your ex-wife's partner,

142
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:48,928
she said she wished
she could go back in time

143
00:09:49,086 --> 00:09:51,442
so she could reverse back
over his body.

144
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:57,355
Kids' imagination, huh?
It's wild!

145
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,876
This is not
a joking matter.

146
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,062
Who is joking?

147
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:17,501

00:10:18,478 --> 00:10:19,714

00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:24,197
The only straight pencil-pusher
in Moscow? What do you want?

150
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:26,718
You need to take Irina's symptoms
seriously.

151
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:29,948
I DO take them seriously.
Look at my face.

152
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,983
I take them
very, extremely seriously.

153
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:38,575
Now, can you
discharge her, please?

154
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,439
- It's not in my power.
- You sign for her

155
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:41,417
and she walks! Right?

156
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:45,345
It will take us several weeks.
We have a holiday booked!

157
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,986
Do you want to sit down?

158
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:52,591
No.

159
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:55,483
Your daughter isn't going anywhere
for quite some time.

160
00:10:55,808 --> 00:10:58,089
She's a very disturbed child.

161
00:11:19,061 --> 00:11:20,737
Where IS it?

162
00:11:20,844 --> 00:11:22,996
I know you're in here somewhere.

163
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:31,950
Is this one of those moments
we pretend never happened?

164
00:11:32,897 --> 00:11:35,257
Ew! Who recycles boxer shorts?!

165
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:38,355
Will you help me?

166
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,137
I don't know. I mean, are you
gonna tell me WHY you're in the bin?

167
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:44,433
'Cause I don't want to enable
a mental health crisis.

168
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:46,178
I'm looking for my birthday cake.

169
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,031
You know, I could just give you
money for a croissant.

170
00:11:49,116 --> 00:11:51,532
Might be easier,
bit more dignified.

171
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:53,617
I obviously
don't want to eat it, Bear!

172
00:11:53,701 --> 00:11:55,577
I'm... I'm trying
to find the box it came in

173
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:57,457
so I can see the bakery
it was ordered from.

174
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,341
Right. Right. Got it.

175
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:02,593
Oh, my God! Oh!

176
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:04,696
I found it!

177
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,763
What's this really about, Eve?

178
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:09,741
- Villanelle sent me that cake.
- Oh, shit.

179
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,633
Jamie, what happened?

180
00:12:20,062 --> 00:12:21,357
We got raided.

181
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:23,937
- By who? Who... who raided us?
- The police.

182
00:12:24,256 --> 00:12:25,736
Came with a warrant
this morning.

183
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:27,737
Something about
the Official Secrets Act.

184
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:30,737
Something about obtaining data
illegally. I don't know.

185
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:33,624
Colluding with foreign criminals
on the dark web.

186
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,470
Do we do that?
We don't NOT do that.

187
00:12:37,838 --> 00:12:39,656
Does this mean I'm out of a job?

188
00:12:39,741 --> 00:12:41,792
'Cause this is the only place
I've ever worked where people

189
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:43,436
don't talk about me
behind my back.

190
00:12:43,651 --> 00:12:45,749
Yeah, that's what YOU think.

191
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:49,991
Honestly...
I don't know what it means.

192
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:52,082
I just need a moment
to process this.

193
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:54,838
No. No, you don't.
We don't have time for this.

194
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,537
Bear, do you have your laptop?

195
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:58,857
Get it out. We've got work to do.

196
00:12:58,942 --> 00:12:59,967
What are you gonna do?

197
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:02,738
Google "How to bring down
a global crime syndicate"?

198
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,817
No! I'm gonna Google
a bakery in North London.

199
00:13:07,373 --> 00:13:08,530
Bear.

200
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:11,157
- Don't get involved, mate.
- Why not?

201
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:13,682
It's not like
I have a job anymore, so...

202
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:19,689
Well, I'm gonna start drinking.

203
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:23,526
<i>SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE...</i>

204
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:32,123
This place is amazing.

205
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:34,057
Look what someone just gave me.

206
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:37,168
It's a shank
made out of a toothbrush.

207
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,936
Don't take anything from anyone.

208
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:43,297
Don't make eye contact with anyone.

209
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:46,861
If someone tries to talk to you,
walk away.

210
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:52,736
- What are you doing?
- You're trying to talk to me.

211
00:13:52,837 --> 00:13:54,477
Don't wander off.

212
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:58,049
There are children here
who would kill you

213
00:13:58,141 --> 00:14:00,137
and wear your skin as pashmina.

214
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:02,377
Oh, my God, Dad.

215
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:03,793
I know what you're trying to do,

216
00:14:03,878 --> 00:14:06,194
but your performance
is way over-the-top.

217
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:09,541
You're, like, up here
when you need to be here.

218
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,199
You know,
you should read some Stanislavski.

219
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,369
- I'm not acting.
- Exactly!

220
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:20,457
You're OVER-acting. You need to
mobilise your subconscious.

221
00:14:20,674 --> 00:14:23,923
Tone all this down a little.
It's too much.

222
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:26,115
Listen to me.

223
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:27,974
I am leaving you here.

224
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,208
No, you're trying to scare me.

225
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:31,689
Standard parent crap.

226
00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:32,878
You're doing the whole,

227
00:14:32,963 --> 00:14:35,336
"If you don't stop running over
your mother's boyfriends,

228
00:14:35,421 --> 00:14:36,977
"look where you'll end up" schtick.

229
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:38,289
You're so transparent!

230
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:41,130
If you hadn't been so
damn stupid,

231
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:43,941
we'd both be
lying on a beach right now!

232
00:14:47,206 --> 00:14:49,286
So you're actually leaving me here?

233
00:14:50,901 --> 00:14:53,541
Just for a couple of days,
then I come back for you.

234
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,132
You're a liar.

235
00:14:56,248 --> 00:14:59,724
I have to go to London
and show my face. I can't be here.

236
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:01,577
You're a liar.

237
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:04,364
Why are you
making this difficult?

238
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:07,605
I don't think you understand
the pressure I am under!

239
00:15:07,978 --> 00:15:11,257
There are so many... many balls
in the air above my head

240
00:15:11,341 --> 00:15:13,619
and they're all made of napalm!

241
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:24,027
I see you in two days.

242
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:33,394
Bastard!

243
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:35,115
Yes, I'll hold.

244
00:15:37,981 --> 00:15:42,070
I can't believe I'm still here and
not halfway to cirrhosis in a pub.

245
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,360
Uh, you're here
because you know she's brilliant.

246
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:46,601
Yes, I know technically
it's not legal

247
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:48,617
to divulge
customers' personal information,

248
00:15:48,701 --> 00:15:50,945
but it's not like anyone would...
find out.

249
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,741
You think SHE'S brilliant?

250
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,623
Maybe I should explain
why this cake meant so much.

251
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:58,167
You see, not long ago, my husband
was involved in a serious accident.

252
00:15:58,253 --> 00:15:59,583
- And it's... it's...
- Hold up.

253
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,464
I've... I've...
I've got something here.

254
00:16:01,621 --> 00:16:03,897
Thank God. Had no idea
where I was going with that.

255
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:06,867
Yeah, 'cause pitchfork to the neck
is such a cliche.

256
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:08,537
So these are
all the telephone orders

257
00:16:08,621 --> 00:16:11,287
made in the days
before the cake arrived.

258
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:13,986
And you can see
the origin of the calls here.

259
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:16,602
So London, London, London,
Hertfordshire,

260
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:18,862
London, Essex, Reykjavik.

261
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:22,141
You know, I lost my virginity
in Reykjavik.

262
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:26,417
What?
Nothing.

263
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:28,101
Just surprised.

264
00:16:29,461 --> 00:16:32,327
Surprised that it was in Reykjavik
or surprised that it happened?

265
00:16:32,412 --> 00:16:34,692
Can we get back to it, please?

266
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:38,470
London, Barcelona.

267
00:16:38,574 --> 00:16:39,737
There. Stop there.

268
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:42,334
Dasha Duzran has been
running Villanelle out of Barcelona.

269
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,257
That's got to be her.

270
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:46,097
Um...

271
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,177
...what about recent activity
on the card?

272
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:49,475
Can you get to that, Bear?

273
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,756
- Not legally.
- OK.

274
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,416
Do it anyway.

275
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:56,529
You can't get raided twice in a day.

276
00:16:56,622 --> 00:16:59,136
It's a rule.

277
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:07,177
OK. Looks like it was used
just 20 minutes ago.

278
00:17:07,447 --> 00:17:08,892
Where?

279
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,710
Aberdeen.

280
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,530
You look ridiculous.

281
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,165
It's my family tartan.
We agreed, German.

282
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,366
Germans don't wear kilts.

283
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:37,201
Yeah. I changed my mind.

284
00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:40,257
So, here we are.

285
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,905
You ladies celebrating
something?

286
00:17:44,056 --> 00:17:46,326
- Yes.
- No.

287
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:47,967
My promotion.

288
00:17:48,052 --> 00:17:49,810
We are here on business.

289
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,850
My mother
has a funny sense of humour.

290
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:02,838
It's dementia.

291
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,495
Come on, Mother. Hurry up.

292
00:18:24,316 --> 00:18:25,938
<i>Doors closing.</i>

293
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:32,594
You think you've won because
you've got your stinking promotion?

294
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:33,966
I was trying to be modest,

295
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,806
but if you're going
to force my hand, then...

296
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,767
You have not won. I have won. I've
done everything they asked me to do.

297
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,446
Ever since
they first dumped you on me,

298
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,210
when you had
little mosquito bites for breasts.

299
00:18:45,295 --> 00:18:47,535
And now I get to go home.

300
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:50,271
Home.

301
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:55,773
<i>Doors closing.</i>

302
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:59,080
Do you know what's waiting for you
at home?

303
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,099
Vodka. Proper Russian vodka.

304
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:06,042
Indifference.

305
00:19:06,127 --> 00:19:11,147
Do you think anyone in Russia
cares about a bendy KGB crone?

306
00:19:13,391 --> 00:19:15,162
Russia has vegans now.

307
00:19:15,273 --> 00:19:16,957
Did you know that?

308
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:19,415
You go into a restaurant,
you ask for a stroganoff,

309
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,789
they're going to laugh
in your face.

310
00:19:20,873 --> 00:19:22,246
So what?
So what?

311
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,158
So what? I'm not interested
in hero's welcome.

312
00:19:25,243 --> 00:19:28,667
And if I want stroganoff,
my son can make it for me.

313
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,915
Oh! You didn't know
I had a son?

314
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,252
Oh, maybe
I forgot to mention him.

315
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,457
I'm going to die
with my feet up and my hand held.

316
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:40,976
Whereas you, you have destroyed
any home you ever had.

317
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:43,526
And you're going to die alone.

318
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:46,646
Does your son have
your halitosis?

319
00:19:46,877 --> 00:19:50,122
Well, you're funny.
I give you that.

320
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:51,646
No, seriously.

321
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,486
Can I have his number?

322
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:58,213
It's such an intoxicating scent.

323
00:20:20,693 --> 00:20:21,799
Hi.

324
00:20:27,124 --> 00:20:30,246
What is it
with everyone hiding in the dark?!

325
00:20:30,777 --> 00:20:32,301
You want to send me
to an early grave?

326
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,826
I'm so sorry. I... I thought
it would be a nice surprise.

327
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:38,722
There's no such thing
as a nice surprise!

328
00:20:39,986 --> 00:20:44,044
- How do you get in?
- You left a key with your neighbour.

329
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:47,206
How stupid of me!

330
00:20:47,644 --> 00:20:49,606
Uh, here.

331
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:51,807
Have some water.

332
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:57,219
You look nice.
Oh...

333
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,576
I... I feel so stupid now.

334
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:02,766
I... I...

335
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,406
...I brought steak and wine.

336
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,748
I thought we could have a...
proper dinner together, but...

337
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,835
...maybe I should go.

338
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,178
It's not a great time.
Yeah, I should go.

339
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:13,486
I sh... I should...

340
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,526
...I should never have, erm...

341
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,526
Uh...

342
00:21:17,954 --> 00:21:22,046
...I guess Mum's been
extra difficult recently

343
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,925
and I... I just wanted
to get away for a night.

344
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,286
I...

345
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,825
...I think she's on the verge
of discovering something big and...

346
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:33,020
...you know how she is when
she's got the bit between her teeth.

347
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:35,326
Anyway.

348
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:38,043
Stupid.

349
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:41,086
What kind of steak?

350
00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:43,166
Uh...

351
00:21:43,848 --> 00:21:45,330
...fillet mignon.

352
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,850
I do like fillet mignon.

353
00:21:54,408 --> 00:21:55,566
You bastard!

354
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,086
What?! I said I liked it.

355
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,924
Mum said you were trying to play me
and I didn't believe her.

356
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:03,902
Can we do this another time?

357
00:22:03,987 --> 00:22:05,936
And let you disappear
into the ether?

358
00:22:06,021 --> 00:22:07,806
I won't disappear into the ether.

359
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,766
OK, I WILL disappear into the ether.

360
00:22:10,097 --> 00:22:12,403
But you have to understand,
it's not personal.

361
00:22:12,488 --> 00:22:15,327
Not personal?!
Shh! Inside voices.

362
00:22:15,412 --> 00:22:18,028
I will make as much noise
as I like!

363
00:22:18,113 --> 00:22:22,112
Just once, I want to make a scene
and not be told to be quiet

364
00:22:22,197 --> 00:22:25,489
or to pull myself together
or that I'm being ridiculous!

365
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:27,228
- Fine.
- Seeking out someone

366
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:29,129
whose brother has just died,

367
00:22:29,317 --> 00:22:31,096
taking advantage
of their grief

368
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:33,105
when they're at their
most vulnerable,

369
00:22:33,702 --> 00:22:35,622
what kind of person
does that?

370
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:38,189
A shit.

371
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,247
I'm a shit. OK?

372
00:22:48,262 --> 00:22:51,275
I used you
to spy on your mother.

373
00:22:51,922 --> 00:22:53,402
Happy?

374
00:22:56,178 --> 00:22:58,014
I hope you die.

375
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,897
It's very possible.

376
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:20,005
I am going to miss this.

377
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:24,380
Looking like a prophylactic
that can't play golf?

378
00:23:26,344 --> 00:23:28,196
Killing people.

379
00:23:29,234 --> 00:23:33,003
That feeling you get the moment
before you snuff out a life.

380
00:23:33,185 --> 00:23:38,094
When you can see your own eyes
reflected in dilated pupils,

381
00:23:38,261 --> 00:23:43,751
when you can count the number of
breaths they have left on one hand.

382
00:23:43,835 --> 00:23:46,282
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

383
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:48,471
Ha-ha! Whoo-hoo!

384
00:23:48,555 --> 00:23:50,191
He's crying out to be killed.

385
00:23:50,275 --> 00:23:52,293
<i>- OK.</i>
- Ugh!

386
00:23:52,883 --> 00:23:55,565
I killed so many Americans
in Cold War

387
00:23:55,652 --> 00:23:59,430
you could make
giant greasy tapestry out of them.

388
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:03,019
They were less fat then,
but just so loud.

389
00:24:03,104 --> 00:24:06,903
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

390
00:24:07,141 --> 00:24:09,311
Whoo! Yeah!

391
00:24:09,684 --> 00:24:11,515
Oh, yeah.
You can do it if you like.

392
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:15,568
Kill him?
One of us has to do it.

393
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,558
If it means so much to you,
you can do it. Hm?

394
00:24:19,322 --> 00:24:21,842
Look at it
as my retirement present.

395
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,991
- You have lost it, haven't you?
- What?

396
00:24:25,075 --> 00:24:27,012
Yeah, you have lost it.

397
00:24:27,155 --> 00:24:29,151
You want me to kill him
because you are afraid

398
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:31,128
you won't be able to do it again.

399
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:35,675
Oh, boy. This is priceless.
I tell you one thing.

400
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,751
I'm glad that they agreed
to send me home

401
00:24:37,836 --> 00:24:41,352
before they realised
they had promoted a dud.

402
00:24:43,675 --> 00:24:45,524
Get out of my way, please.

403
00:25:02,865 --> 00:25:04,505
Whoops!

404
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:17,394
I got the train
down to London couple of years back.

405
00:25:17,478 --> 00:25:20,442
Me and the wife are big fans of
true-crime walking tours, you see,

406
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:23,549
and if you want to get the most
serial killer bang for your buck,

407
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:26,470
the capital is the only place to be,
you know.

408
00:25:26,562 --> 00:25:29,213
Jack the Ripper, Dennis Nilsen,
John Christie.

409
00:25:29,324 --> 00:25:31,298
Ah, we've done 'em all.

410
00:25:31,795 --> 00:25:33,390
You ever tried one?

411
00:25:34,435 --> 00:25:36,481
What? Oh. Uh, no, I don't think so.

412
00:25:36,566 --> 00:25:38,350
Och, you must. Aye, sure.

413
00:25:38,435 --> 00:25:42,111
Some people have a problem with the
glorification of the violence, etc,

414
00:25:42,195 --> 00:25:44,871
but me and the wife, we love it.

415
00:25:45,047 --> 00:25:47,322
Not in real life, you understand.
No, no, no.

416
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:48,830
We're really very law-abiding.

417
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:50,910
I mean, I don't even kill spiders.

418
00:25:50,995 --> 00:25:53,596
<i>- Yep?</i>
- Bear. Am... am I in the right place?

419
00:25:53,681 --> 00:25:55,318
Um...

420
00:25:55,531 --> 00:25:57,315
- ...Castle Stuart?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

421
00:25:57,425 --> 00:25:58,589
Sure this is the last place

422
00:25:58,674 --> 00:26:00,182
- the card was used?
- Positive.

423
00:26:02,955 --> 00:26:05,595
Hey! They're coming.

424
00:26:10,204 --> 00:26:11,431
Hey!

425
00:26:14,037 --> 00:26:17,197
Hey!

426
00:26:18,268 --> 00:26:20,664
- Hi.
- Hey!

427
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:22,871
<i>Oh, yeah, pull over here.</i>

428
00:26:22,955 --> 00:26:24,835
Excuse me! Sir?

429
00:26:26,195 --> 00:26:28,551
Will you help me get my ball?

430
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:30,951
My mother's frail
and unsteady on her feet

431
00:26:31,035 --> 00:26:33,853
and we don't want to
go into the woods alone.

432
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:36,711
Catch you later.
Sure.

433
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:40,075
Deal's off.
I'm doing this one.

434
00:26:41,555 --> 00:26:44,240
You know,
some girls would stop themselves

435
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:46,311
asking for help from a man
these days.

436
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,314
They do it
as a matter of principle.

437
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,355
Oof! Not me.

438
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:53,991
I was brought up in a family where
men were men and women were women

439
00:26:54,075 --> 00:26:55,791
and women liked their men to be men.

440
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,711
Aye. That's how we did it.

441
00:26:57,795 --> 00:26:58,871
Damn right.

442
00:26:58,955 --> 00:27:02,711
And that's why I don't have a
problem promoting women to my board.

443
00:27:02,995 --> 00:27:07,951
Because your lack of know-how
gives me an excuse to feel heroic.

444
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:14,151
I'm only joking, natch.

445
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:15,794
What do you say in this country?

446
00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:19,035
Don't get your knickers in a twist.
No, no. You got it in one.

447
00:27:19,456 --> 00:27:21,551
I can't tell you the amount of times
I've gone to hit the ball

448
00:27:21,635 --> 00:27:23,871
and hit something else entirely!

449
00:27:25,595 --> 00:27:27,671
It's just in here somewhere.

450
00:27:27,826 --> 00:27:29,346
OK.

451
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,145
OK.

452
00:27:51,235 --> 00:27:53,143
Oh, I think I see it!

453
00:27:53,555 --> 00:27:56,191
It's just
in that patch of ferns over there.

454
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:58,111
- Allow me.
- Oh!

455
00:27:59,452 --> 00:28:01,470
Isn't this wonderful, Mum?

456
00:28:01,716 --> 00:28:04,266
The kind gentleman's
getting the ball for us.

457
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,860
It's playing hard to get.

458
00:28:07,634 --> 00:28:10,710
Do they not have belts in America?
Ugh.

459
00:28:14,168 --> 00:28:16,391
Three...

460
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,290
...two...

461
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:20,819
...one.

462
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,392
There you go!

463
00:28:24,918 --> 00:28:27,150
Oh!

464
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,811
Oh, God!

465
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,985
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

466
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,426
Stuff that
in your fanny pack and eat it!

467
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:44,016
Oh, my God!
What are you waiting for? Run!

468
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:02,551
I didn't care much for London,
it must be said.

469
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:04,991
Too busy for my liking.
Too dangerous.

470
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:06,871
I always feel safe round here.

471
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:10,582
How about you? How do you find
our wee part of the world?

472
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:14,430
Jesus Christ!

473
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:17,181
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>
- Let him in!

474
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:20,502
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
Oh, my God!

475
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:23,556
- What happened?
- There's a crazy woman on the loose!

476
00:29:23,641 --> 00:29:26,163
- What does she look like?
- Why? Why? What does that matter?

477
00:29:26,248 --> 00:29:28,511
- What does she look like?!
- I just saw a pretty face.

478
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:31,025
Pretty girl. Nice figure.

479
00:29:31,132 --> 00:29:33,288
- She was with her mom.
- Her mother?

480
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,601
Yeah. She hit her mom in the head
with a golf club.

481
00:29:35,686 --> 00:29:36,549
- OK, where was this?
- What?!

482
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:38,511
Where was this?!
I don't know. Uh, 16th hole.

483
00:29:38,595 --> 00:29:40,423
About half a mile that way.
OK, get out.

484
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:42,508
What?!
Get out! Get out! Get out!

485
00:29:43,508 --> 00:29:46,904
What is this vile country?!
Get out, get out, get out!

486
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,511
Drive to the 16th hole, now!

00:32:50,452 --> 00:32:54,048
The FSB wants to kill me.
The Twelve want to kill me.

520
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:55,783
Carolyn's daughter wants to kill me.

521
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:58,344
My ex-wife wants to kill me.
My daughter wants to kill me.

522
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:00,306
My ex-wife's new boyfriend
would want to kill me

523
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,826
if he wasn't already dead!

524
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:03,947
Look where you're going, idiot!

525
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:06,268
That random guy
now wants to kill me.

526
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:08,092
I thought you didn't want
to talk about it.

527
00:33:08,177 --> 00:33:09,213
I don't.

528
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:11,499
Well, I'm hearing a lot of
something that sounds like talking

529
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:14,259
for someone who
"don't want to talk about it".

530
00:33:14,344 --> 00:33:16,140
I think I'm just
really, really tired.

531
00:33:16,383 --> 00:33:18,196
Ugh. Up your magnesium.

532
00:33:18,346 --> 00:33:20,706
Maybe I shouldn't go.
Oh! Are you serious?

533
00:33:22,694 --> 00:33:24,269
Maybe I should
just let them kill me.

534
00:33:24,354 --> 00:33:25,723
Wow!

535
00:33:25,808 --> 00:33:28,157
Bring the mood down,
why don't you?

536
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:31,730
What I am going to do
in Cuba anyway?

537
00:33:31,815 --> 00:33:34,847
I burn like that!
Read books on the beach.

538
00:33:35,237 --> 00:33:37,833
Smoke cigars.
Get your legs out.

539
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,486
Don't get murdered.

540
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:42,518
Wherever I go,
someone wants to murder me.

541
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:45,802
I can run as far as I want -
they will still come!

542
00:33:46,731 --> 00:33:50,765
Ha! I probably deserve it.
You definitely deserve it.

543
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:54,022
This way, you can get murdered
in a cute Havana shirt.

544
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:57,252
Let's face it, Villanelle.

545
00:33:57,337 --> 00:33:58,773
I'm a prick.

546
00:33:58,858 --> 00:34:02,254
And the only thing I'm
waiting for is another prick to...

547
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:04,438
...another prick to...

548
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,673
Shit!

549
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,860
Another prick to shit?
What is that?

550
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:18,822
Are you faking it?

551
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:24,727
Get up! Get up.

552
00:34:27,258 --> 00:34:30,018
Oh! You can't die on me now.

553
00:34:32,498 --> 00:34:33,720
Oh! How do we get the money?

554
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,282
Where is the money?
I don't want to die.

555
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:37,522
I'll come back for you, I promise.

556
00:34:37,607 --> 00:34:40,087
- But I need the money.
- My pocket.

557
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:47,470
I don't want to die.
Shut up!

558
00:34:48,818 --> 00:34:51,022
I don't want you to die either.

559
00:34:54,183 --> 00:34:55,739
I really don't.

560
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,291
But you actually might.

561
00:35:04,738 --> 00:35:08,098
<i>MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY OVER P.A.</i>...

562
00:35:13,698 --> 00:35:15,894
No, he just collapsed.
Can anyone help?

563
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:22,694
I know him.

564
00:35:22,857 --> 00:35:24,497
OK.
Konstantin!

565
00:35:26,277 --> 00:35:27,904
Has anyone called
an ambulance?

566
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:29,586
They're on their way.

567
00:35:30,415 --> 00:35:32,015
Konstantin.

568
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:34,679

Geraldine!

I'm going to get a takeaway,

580
00:36:51,488 --> 00:36:53,994
and it's terribly un-cost-effective
for one person,

581
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,732
so you're going to
have to come in on it.

582
00:36:55,817 --> 00:36:57,671
I don't know
what kind of thing you find...

583
00:36:57,756 --> 00:37:00,554
...acceptable to eat nowadays,
but I'm sure that...

584
00:37:00,649 --> 00:37:02,895
...Hampstead will provide.

585
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:05,578
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing. What's the matter with you?

586
00:37:05,662 --> 00:37:08,011
Nothing. You're ordering a takeaway?

587
00:37:08,096 --> 00:37:09,976
Don't argue with me.
We're celebrating.

588
00:37:11,136 --> 00:37:14,278
A weasel that I thought was a weasel
turns out to be...

589
00:37:15,178 --> 00:37:17,252
- A weasel?
- Yeah. Well done.

590
00:37:17,939 --> 00:37:20,005
I don't mind.
Uh, anything vegetarian.

591
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,458
Of course.

592
00:37:21,543 --> 00:37:23,655
Uh, I'm going to order upstairs
and then I'm going to run a bath

593
00:37:23,739 --> 00:37:25,215
while we're waiting.

594
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:27,950
That's the kind of self-care
you're always advocating, isn't it?

595
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:33,870
Hugh. This better be good.

596
00:37:33,955 --> 00:37:35,135
I'm about to have a bath.

597
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:45,292
Mum, the bath's overflowing!

598
00:37:45,725 --> 00:37:47,711
- Did you turn it off?
- Of course I turned it off.

599
00:37:47,795 --> 00:37:49,886
There's two inches of water
all over the floor!

600
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:56,727
You're not really OK, are you?

601
00:37:57,805 --> 00:38:01,387
Don't be ridiculous. I've had
some disappointing news, that's all.

602
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:05,545
- Nothing to get het up about.
- Well, what was it?

603
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,420
The news.
I can't say.

604
00:38:07,505 --> 00:38:09,335
His family haven't been informed yet.

605
00:38:09,794 --> 00:38:11,312
Mum, did someone die?

606
00:38:12,154 --> 00:38:14,695
Don't look so shocked,
Geraldine.

607
00:38:16,316 --> 00:38:17,961
It's not like Kenny.

608
00:38:18,064 --> 00:38:19,589
He wasn't a
member of the public.

609
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:21,140
He was... fully briefed.

610
00:38:21,225 --> 00:38:22,442
He knew the risks.

611
00:38:24,062 --> 00:38:25,782
It was Mo.

612
00:38:26,995 --> 00:38:29,535
I fear the walls
may be closing in on me.

613
00:38:30,339 --> 00:38:31,930
It's starting to feel personal.

614
00:38:32,015 --> 00:38:33,954
Why didn't you tell me?

615
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,173
You said it was
nothing to get het up about.

616
00:38:37,258 --> 00:38:39,535
How can you be so bloody calm?

617
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:43,705
What is wrong with you?!
You're an emotional iceberg!

618
00:38:50,826 --> 00:38:52,262
I'm sorry.

619
00:38:52,347 --> 00:38:53,913
I-I'm...

620
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:55,859
...I'm sorry.

621
00:38:58,394 --> 00:39:00,985
Don't... come at me like that.

622
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,591
I'm not... coming at you.

623
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:04,335
I'm trying to hug you.
Just don't.

624
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:05,919
Mum!

625
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,589
I'm warning you, Geraldine.

626
00:39:08,674 --> 00:39:10,015
This isn't healthy.

627
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:12,538
It can't go on.

628
00:39:12,623 --> 00:39:16,654
You can't... just refuse to feel
anything for the rest of your life.

629
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:19,053
What... what kind of existence
is that?

630
00:39:19,138 --> 00:39:23,427
You... you have to find some way
to express yourself!

631
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:45,008
Is that the kind of thing
you were after?

632
00:39:51,745 --> 00:39:53,588
We've put
in a stent to unblock your artery,

633
00:39:53,672 --> 00:39:56,148
but we'll need to look
at some lifestyle changes.

634
00:39:56,419 --> 00:39:58,815
Have you been under
any increased stress lately?

635
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,141
- Mr Vasiliev?
- Yeah.

636
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:07,905
Heart attacks are associated
with greater levels of cortisol

637
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,499
in the blood.

638
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:12,237
Is there anything
that's been bothering you?

639
00:40:17,509 --> 00:40:19,935
- Mr Vasiliev?
- Yes.
