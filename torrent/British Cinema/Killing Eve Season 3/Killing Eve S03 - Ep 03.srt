00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,809
Eve... she is alive.

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,099
It's not possible.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,109
Poor Kenny.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,529
I can't let people know
I'm looking into things.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,947
I have Kenny's phone.

6
00:00:16,948 --> 00:00:19,239
- We just guessed it was you.
- What?!

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,689
They are making me a Keeper.

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,245
They want you to work
with somebody first.

9
00:00:23,246 --> 00:00:25,080
Bonjour !

10
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:26,454
Management is not easy.

11
00:00:26,455 --> 00:00:29,169
It's watching someone
do job worse than you.

12
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,789
I deserve more. More than you.

13
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,339
What was Kenny working
on before he died?

14
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,449
There's a thumb drive.
The police have it.

15
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,699
I need to know what happened,

16
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,430
who killed him.

It's not even yours.

45
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,899
And what about the coroner's report?

46
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,107
There's no signs of a struggle.

47
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:27,549
No evidence of asphyxiation
or internal injury.

48
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,389
Basically, he was
absolutely fine until he...

49
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,955
- ... hit the ground.
- May I?

50
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,629
So...

51
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,189
... the head of the MPS
is still saying it's suicide,

52
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,910
despite the lack of note or motivation.

53
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,539
That is reassuring.

54
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,949
It'd be really unsettling if he
actually got something right.

55
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,827
Geraldine said I could
come straight in...

56
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,249
Oh.

57
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,679
Wow!

58
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,730
Oh, get over it, Eve.

59
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,399
I have all my best thoughts in the bath.

60
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,109
If Mo can manage, you can.

61
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,153
I haven't looked up in 10 minutes.

62
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,889
Did you get Kenny's thumb
drive back from the police?

63
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,787
- At quite a cost, yes.
- I'd rather not know.

64
00:05:16,455 --> 00:05:19,208
- Oh, I'll... I'll meet you downstairs.
- Oh!

65
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,045
Who's that?

66
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,257
Our Bitter Pill representative.

67
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:27,849
I invited him.

68
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,512
Before I knew this meeting
was in a bathroom.

69
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,180
Mo, would you just pass
me a towel, please?

70
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,629
So, we have the burner
phone and the thumb drive.

71
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,750
What else do we have to go on?

72
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,550
Excellent. Good meeting.

73
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,619
- Meetings have biscuits.
- You can have a biscuit

74
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,149
when you tell me what
the point of you is.

75
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,209
Planning on analysing those
yourself, then, are you?

76
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,513
I think the world's foremost
intelligence agency might handle it.

77
00:06:14,514 --> 00:06:18,409
What, that public school,
what-ho-ing, old boy's network?

78
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,590
I don't think a beer fridge
and a beanbag breakout area

79
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,787
gives you any great insight
into global politics.

80
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:26,190
- That's...
- Enough, okay? Enough!

81
00:06:26,191 --> 00:06:29,236
Carolyn, you and Mo take
the phone, we'll take the...

82
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:30,510
... thumb thingy.

83
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,906
'Cause you know what we do from now on?

84
00:06:31,907 --> 00:06:34,115
- We share.
- Wow.

85
00:06:34,116 --> 00:06:37,995
That is literally the most parenting
this household has ever seen.

86
00:06:41,415 --> 00:06:44,507
So, you thought this was good idea?

87
00:06:44,508 --> 00:06:47,909
I'm practising my characters,
like you told me.

88
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,799
Young mother and baby... and Grandma.

89
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,430
What got into you? You have been
unfocused and manic for days.

90
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,467
I'm just having some fun.

91
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,770
Stop that. I don't like it.

92
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,209
You would think, after your
last managerial disaster,

93
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,329
you would learn to keep your head down.

94
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,929
It is not my fault he was an idiot.

95
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,009
I keep telling them to look
harder for good recruits.

96
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,569
But what can you do?

97
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,662
Eh...

98
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,290
You think that's funny?!

99
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,586
I'll show you what's funny.
You come with me,

100
00:07:28,587 --> 00:07:30,129
because I've had enough.

101
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,309
Now, that is funny.

102
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,430
You want to amuse yourself, go crazy.

103
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,821
But I will not have you put
both of our futures at risk.

104
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:58,149
- I'm the one doing all the work.
- You think handling you isn't work?

105
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,239
Why you think no-one else
is prepared to do it?

106
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,709
Bad pension scheme?

107
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,882
You should get your act together.

108
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,873
You know? Jobs will get tougher.

109
00:08:05,874 --> 00:08:08,793
And they will not let you
get away with being sloppy.

110
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:10,749
Sloppy? Hmm...

111
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,650
_

112
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,919
No.

113
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,939
"No"? What do you mean, "No"?

114
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,067
It's too soon.

115
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:33,720
I have to prepare.

116
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,580
I'm not ready. How about that?

117
00:08:36,588 --> 00:08:38,322
Not ready for London?

118
00:08:38,323 --> 00:08:42,699
All you need is anorak
and face like cheese.

119
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,379
You're right.

120
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,369
You're right. I know what I'm doing.

121
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,830
I can handle this.

122
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:05,009
This is bank stuff.

123
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,789
Financial data.

124
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,769
Oh, he said something about accounts.

125
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,279
Damn it. What was it?

126
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,619
Do you want one?

127
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,409
What? Oh... No, I... No.

128
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,417
Once I pop, I just can't stop.

129
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,962
You can. It's just about self-control.

130
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,424
But I don't have any self-control.

131
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,723
All these are different accounts,
in different locations.

132
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,550
One of them must have
meant something to Kenny.

133
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,106
That one is different.

134
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,490
Mm.

135
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,969
R-U-R'.

136
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,359
Code, maybe?

137
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,210
It is. Where's, um... ?

138
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,948
Where's that Rubik's Cube?

139
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:04,951
The only way I can solve this is
by taking off all the stickers.

140
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:06,209
No, we don't need to solve it.

141
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,549
It's cube notation.

142
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,849
He's told us what to do.

143
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,309
Okay, um, turn it right
face, 90 degrees clockwise.

144
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,079
Is that supposed to
mean something to me?

145
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,490
No.

146
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,479
Okay. Uh, U.

147
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,039
Upwards, 90 degrees.

148
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,509
- R'.
- Right face, anti-clockwise.

149
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,049
U2.

150
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,142
And F'.

151
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:30,610
That's it.

152
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:34,106
"Shh... nap."

153
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,690
"Shnap".

154
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:44,867
Panda.

155
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,410
Kenny named the account 'Panda'.

156
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,719
Kenny and I were looking into
an international organi...

157
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,159
Okay, but before I go on,
you have to understand

158
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,499
that once I tell you about them,
your lives are in danger.

159
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,639
- Then don't tell us...
- They're called The Twelve.

160
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,189
And they've infiltrated
governments and organizations

161
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,479
all over the world.

162
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,629
We don't know what their endgame is,

163
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,769
but we do know they've been responsible

164
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,430
for a significant number
of international murders.

165
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,189
Okay, now, Fat Panda was a
Chinese intelligence officer

166
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,559
killed in Berlin.

167
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,989
He was tracking a double
agent for The Twelve

168
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,349
who was being paid from
a bank account in...

169
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,739
... the Cayman Islands.

170
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,709
Right.

171
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,879
The double agent was an MI5
officer named Frank Haleton.

172
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,414
What happened to Frank?

173
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,999
He lost his knob...

174
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,539
... and his life.

175
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,929
In that order?

176
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,756
Well, The Twelve wanted a hit on him,

177
00:11:40,757 --> 00:11:42,669
but the...

178
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,310
... but the assassin was...

179
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,596
- ... she had a flair for...
- She?

180
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,639
The account went dormant
after Frank's death,

181
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,849
but Kenny found it was active again.

182
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,079
Three bank transfers in
the last two months,

183
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,619
totalling just over six million euros.

184
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,399
And the remaining balance moved
to an account in Geneva.

185
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,119
So, who owns the Geneva account?

186
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,859
We don't know.

187
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,829
We need someone who can get into
some very classified banking info.

188
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,535
Yes, we do.

189
00:12:11,536 --> 00:12:14,581
- No, we do not go to them.
- Yes, we do.

190
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,109
The thing is we can't trace the account.

191
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,709
Well, yeah. You don't set
up an account in Geneva

192
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,759
for transparency.

193
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,010
But you could trace it, right?

194
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,478
I thought you were
looking into the phone.

195
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,100
That was the deal, wasn't it?

196
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,189
Or did Charlie Big
Potatoes change his mind

197
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,519
because he didn't get a Hobnob.

198
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,229
- Come on. We're in this together.
- Are we?

199
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,409
Because no-one else is
having to work at MI6

200
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,829
whilst moonlighting for Carolyn,

201
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,989
and now you want me to trace...

202
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,090
Did you take this job thinking
it would be easier?

203
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:45,237
If you did, quit now, 'cause
it's only getting tougher.

204
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,199
I'll see what I can do.

205
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,529
Great.

206
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,300
Oh, and, uh...

207
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,790
That's who we think has been
on their hit-list so far.

208
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,712
You know, I've been going
through the MI6 case files

209
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:05,257
you and Kenny worked on.

210
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,511
You really should have some kind of
protection. You know that, right?

211
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,169
Do you have any idea what happens
to people who are protected by MI6?

212
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,600
What?

213
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,439
It's not good.

214
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,170
- Charles Kruger.
- It's me.

215
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,999
- Who's me?
- Just let me in.

216
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:36,999
Na zdorovie.

217
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,119
Ah!

218
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,249
Look at us, Kostya. We're old.

219
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,969
The kids are all grown up.

220
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,759
I'm going to see my son's
graduation next month.

221
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,139
This modern dance is... is so visceral!

222
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,919
Have you ever locked and popped, Kostya?

223
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,181
No! You'd, uh, displace
a hip these days.

224
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:57,809
Hey? Wouldn't you?

225
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,688
You wanted to see me.

226
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,290
Yeah.

227
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,410
Um...

228
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,599
Somebody's been siphoning money
from the Geneva account.

229
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,703
I managed to retrieve what's left,

230
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:20,207
but a pretty sizeable
chunk's been taken.

231
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,833
How much has gone?

232
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,459
Uh, six million, in total.

233
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,770
Whew!

234
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,079
- Do you know who?
- No.

235
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,130
Not yet. But I will find
the person responsible.

236
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,130
I'll make some calls,
see what I can find.

237
00:14:42,104 --> 00:14:45,189
Uh, the money, Konstantin.

238
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,489
I... I prefer the money.

239
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,159
If you could...

240
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,629
... tide me over.

241
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,590
You know, just buys me some
time till I find the scoundrel.

242
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,659
- Okay.
- Thank you.

243
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,010
Thank you.

244
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,421
How's Irina these days?
Still a little shit?

245
00:15:07,422 --> 00:15:11,079
She's like a little shit
taking a shit on a big shit.

246
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,319
Three shit combined
into one enormous shit.

247
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,259
That's wonderful!

248
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,690
Kids!

249
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,470
Kids...

250
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,900
_

251
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,430
I want to smell powerful.

252
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,363
I want to make people gag with it.

253
00:16:16,364 --> 00:16:18,399
Can you do that for me?

254
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,879
Well...

255
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,288
... we have some lovely floral
fragrances for ladies over here.

256
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:26,159
The iris, in particular,

257
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,769
- is a very powerful...
- Maybe I should describe to you

258
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,419
what I'm thinking.

259
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,008
Let me get a pen.

260
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:37,390
Hmm.

261
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:44,610
I want to smell like
a Roman centurion...

262
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,430
... who's coming across an old foe...

263
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,829
... who, in battle, once...

264
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,850
... hurt him greatly.

265
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:02,850
Oh, but since then, the Roman
centurion has become...

266
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:05,639
... Emperor...

267
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,457
... and is now powerful beyond measure.

268
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,378
Maybe something more woody.

269
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,249
Mm.

270
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,910
I think it's wonderful
you're letting people in.

271
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,710
We all need intimacy in our lives.

272
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,263
Even people who keep
secrets for a living.

273
00:17:21,264 --> 00:17:23,690
Nonsense, there are monks in China

274
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,910
who go years without seeing
another human being.

275
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,859
They probably have different kind of...

276
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,397
Emily Bronte. Hardly left the house.

277
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,019
Mum...

278
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,159
... I'm proud of you for
trying something new.

279
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,519
Dating is scary, but...

280
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,149
... pushing ourselves out of our
comfort zones is how we grow.

281
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,069
You know what's scary, Geraldine,

282
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,370
is how much I regret
telling you it's a date.

283
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:56,649
I'm so happy you're doing
something for you.

284
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,030
Kenny would be too.

285
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,969
He always wanted you to meet some...

286
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,519
Here, let me...

287
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,680
No, it's better without it.

288
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,249
And don't talk about Stalin.

289
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,039
He's strictly third date.

290
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,009
Another drink while you wait, madam?

291
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,530
No, thank you, Tom.

292
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,959
I think there comes a time

293
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,229
when one must admit... defeat.

294
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,020
Henrik?

295
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,750
Carolyn!

296
00:19:02,447 --> 00:19:04,114
Wha...

297
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:05,367
Mwah.

298
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,529
Mwah.

299
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,700
Sorry.

300
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,748
How incredible!

301
00:19:12,749 --> 00:19:14,779
I adore a coincidence!

302
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,089
It makes me feel I'm in the right place.

303
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,962
It must be, what 20 years?

304
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:20,359
Yeah.

305
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,849
Yeah, 21, it must be.

306
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,520
1999's the year I got divorced.

307
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,049
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah, yeah.

308
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,557
Yeah.

309
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:31,589
For the first time.

310
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,349
- Well...
- Yeah.

311
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,549
If it makes you feel any better,
I've just had the novel experience

312
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,770
of being stood up.

313
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:43,654
No... What?!

314
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:45,322
Surely... You?!

315
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:47,360
Don't worry. I'll have him killed.

316
00:19:50,995 --> 00:19:52,162
Listen, you, um...

317
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:54,331
Do you want to get something to eat?

318
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,668
What about your charming friends?

319
00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:00,419
Hmm? They disgust me. Come on.

320
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,249
Come on. What do you fancy? Seafood?

321
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,439
- Oh...
- Steak? No?

322
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,159
There is one thing...

323
00:20:13,393 --> 00:20:17,349
I must say, the years have
been good to you, Henrik.

324
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,829
Yeah.

325
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,309
Terrible lifestyle... suits me, hmm?

326
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,649
So, Geneva's still treating you well?

327
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,999
What, the bank?!

328
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,159
I-I... Don't get me started.

329
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,399
No, do go on.

330
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,370
There's nothing I enjoy more than
some salacious financial gossip.

331
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,279
Is she okay?

332
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,759
The official line is migraine.

333
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,639
I'm having an aura, Eve.

334
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,319
It's probably stress-related.

335
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,935
You know a great cure for that?

336
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:58,228
Paracetamol.

337
00:20:58,229 --> 00:21:00,919
Did you find out who owns the account?

338
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,479
Yes.

339
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,029
It's a 92-year-old sugar-beet
farmer in East Anglia.

340
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,404
Who died nine years ago.

341
00:21:07,405 --> 00:21:10,439
The real owner... is this guy.

342
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,769
Charles Kruger.

343
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,430
Born Sergei Korchmarev in East Berlin.

344
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,249
And who was very gorgeous in his day.

345
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,829
Oh, another one of your Cold
War boyfriends, Carolyn?

346
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,329
Don't be ridiculous, Eve.

347
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,669
- We barely had a night together.
- Yeah, we get it.

348
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,963
You had a great time in the '80s.

349
00:21:23,964 --> 00:21:28,049
So, Korchmarev disappeared
from Russia around 1989,

350
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,799
eventually showing up in London

351
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,450
and presenting himself as amiable
accountant Charles Kruger.

352
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,143
Do you think he could actually be
the accountant for The Twelve?

353
00:21:38,144 --> 00:21:40,897
I'm thinking he's definitely
worth a visit to Kensington.

354
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,719
- I'll head right there.
- And do what?

355
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,969
Wait in the car with a bottle
of pop and a bag of crisps?

356
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,489
Be hard enough to get him to talk to me.

357
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,239
He's definitely not gonna talk
to somebody he doesn't know.

358
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,615
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

359
00:21:51,616 --> 00:21:53,159
I know how he operates, Eve.

360
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,160
No, I mean...

361
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:57,997
... this is different, remember?

362
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,890
I'm gonna have a shower.

363
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,465
Oh, God...

364
00:22:08,466 --> 00:22:10,217
Oh...

365
00:22:10,218 --> 00:22:13,749
First Henrik, then Sergei.

366
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,089
It's not fun, Eve,

367
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,570
using people you once loved.

368
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,896
It's all rather painful, really.

369
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,850
Do you believe a word of that?

370
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,690
No, I think she loves it.

371
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,390
Would you like to make a talking bear?

372
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,399
This place is psychopathic.

373
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,370
_

374
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,630
_

375
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:41,579
I should have shot you in the head.

376
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,589
I should have shot you in the head.

377
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:53,419
I should have shot you in the
head and watched you die.

378
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,549
I should have shot you in the head

379
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,993
and watched you die.

380
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,877
_

381
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,070
I can't stop thinking about you.

382
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,099
Eve?

383
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,010
Oh, Valerie, hi.

384
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:35,189
- Can I be of help?
- No. I'm just waiting for Niko.

385
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,990
He discharged himself.

386
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,619
What?!

387
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,201
Last week.

388
00:24:41,202 --> 00:24:44,163
He was actually doing very well.

389
00:24:45,748 --> 00:24:50,419
Uh, did he... leave me a note or...

390
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,672
... a forwarding address?

391
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,050
- I'm afraid I can't...
- Valerie...

392
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,880
I'm his wife.

393
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,889
He did say something about Poland.

394
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,385
_

395
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,913
Hi, Eve.

396
00:26:14,087 --> 00:26:15,087
Eve!

397
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,589
I'm not here for you.

398
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,349
No! No!

399
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,151
Smell me, Eve.

400
00:26:38,778 --> 00:26:41,129
What do I smell of to you?

401
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,810
Oh...

402
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,070
I don't want to talk about it.

403
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,709
- Eve?
- I said...

404
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,873
... I don't want to talk about it.

405
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,379
So, what now?

406
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,807
We eat toffee eclairs
and watch that doorway.

407
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,329
Can't we just go in?

408
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,439
And ruin the fun of a stake-out?

409
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,710
You wouldn't do that to an old spy, Mo.

410
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,530
Plus... if we go in...

411
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,939
... we're trapped.

412
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,619
Out here, he's accountable.

413
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,010
What happened?

414
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,719
Okay, fine.

415
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,549
I don't give a toss.

416
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:00,270
As long as it's got nothing to do
with what we're working on.

417
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:11,656
There is this... assassin...

418
00:30:11,657 --> 00:30:13,659
... who works for The Twelve.

419
00:30:16,037 --> 00:30:17,705
- Have you got to the chocolate yet?
- Mm.

420
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,370
I've just got it.

421
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,610
When I was younger...

422
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,134
Wait there.

423
00:30:43,147 --> 00:30:44,590
Damn.

424
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,049
Follow him.

425
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,610
I don't think we're gonna
lose him, somehow.

426
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,040
Ah...

427
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,510
_

428
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,840
_

429
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,557
_

430
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,849
Villanelle said she wasn't here for me.

431
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,730
So, let's just think who The
Twelve would want to murder,

432
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,389
aside from me.

433
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,870
Right. Okay.

434
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,899
- Possible assassin targets.
- Oh, my God.

435
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,139
- What?
- Carolyn. It's Carolyn.

436
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,150
They must know we found
their accountant.

437
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,910
So, after you came to
England, what did you do?

438
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,490
An eclair?

439
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:55,177
Well, that won't get you that
three-book deal, Sergei.

440
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:59,432
Tell me what you're going to
wear at your son's graduation.

441
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:03,139
It's next month, isn't it?

442
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,370
Tell me how he does that
thing with his shoulders.

443
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,570
She's not picking up.

444
00:32:18,576 --> 00:32:20,577
Try mine.

445
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,749
Should I share what I think happened

446
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,460
when you swapped the Stasi for HMRC?

447
00:32:30,421 --> 00:32:33,006
I think you accepted a
job from The Twelve,

448
00:32:33,007 --> 00:32:36,209
like the money-grabbing
bottom-feeder you are.

449
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,344
Am I warm?

450
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:44,109
They're on a stake-out!

451
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,960
Who doesn't answer their
phone on a stake-out?!

452
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,979
Uh-oh.

453
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,019
What's going on?

454
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,112
Nothin'.

455
00:32:56,113 --> 00:32:57,907
Just everyone look innocent.

456
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,014
_

457
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,469
Ah...

458
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,482
Oh...

459
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,410
Ohh...

460
00:34:26,412 --> 00:34:27,739
Oh...

461
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,590
Oh...

462
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,138
The husband of classical musician

463
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,059
and influential political
campaigner Isabel Fernandez,

464
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,399
was, this afternoon,
reunited with his baby

465
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,278
who had been missing since
Mrs. Fernandez was found dead

466
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:01,749
at her home yesterday.

467
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,290
He's so happy.

468
00:35:28,015 --> 00:35:29,190
I'm fine.

469
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,030
There's no need for...

470
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,350
I'm fine.

471
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,249
Would you, um...

472
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,299
... pour me a whiskey, Geraldine?

473
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,090
Yes, of course.

474
00:36:58,397 --> 00:37:01,442
Aaaagh!

475
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,574
Don't wait for me in the dark like that!

476
00:37:08,575 --> 00:37:10,279
It's rude!

477
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,785
It's bad for my heart.

478
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,539
Don't you want to know
why I'm in your bed?

479
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,169
Not really, no.

480
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,969
I am too tired for games

481
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,649
and I have to find six
million euros tomorrow.

482
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,289
You will never find
six million in a day.

483
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:36,810
Not even if you sold
both of your kidneys.

484
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:41,749
Technically, you don't
even own them anymore.

485
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,349
The Twelve do.

486
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,694
They own every little bit of you.

487
00:37:46,695 --> 00:37:48,750
Goodnight, Villanelle.

488
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:57,080
What kind of baby do you think I was?

489
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,839
I think I was cute.

490
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,959
Hmm.

491
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,886
Do you think people smiled with
joy when they saw my little face?

492
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,950
God, you're boring.

493
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,989
You're more boring than that
accountant I just shot.

494
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:26,443
And accountants... are really boring.

495
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,323
Hey! Hey! Huh?!

496
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,649
Wakey-wakey, Konstantin!

497
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:37,119
I think you were ugly as hell, okay?

498
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,449
Right.

499
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,833
Well, now you're just
looking for a reaction.

500
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:42,919
No, I'm not.

501
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,829
I've seen a photo of you.

502
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:48,173
Very strange head. Bulbous. Unnatural.

503
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,093
Who was I with?

504
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,303
I don't remember.

505
00:38:54,304 --> 00:38:55,690
Hmm.

506
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,810
I want to find my family.

507
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,429
Why?

508
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,349
So you can feel like dirt the whole time

509
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,750
about how you're letting them down?

510
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,940
Smell me.

511
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,573
No.

512
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,249
Smell me, hmm? What do I smell of?

513
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,259
What am I wearing?

514
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,286
- I don't know.
- Ah.

515
00:39:18,287 --> 00:39:20,839
Power.

516
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,789
I'm wearing power, and to keep power,

517
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:27,087
you need knowledge.

518
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,716
You'll find them for me.

519
00:39:30,717 --> 00:39:32,467
Okay?

520
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,150
I sleep on the couch.

521
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,950
Hello?

522
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,650
Oh...

523
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,950
Admit it, Eve.

524
00:40:36,073 --> 00:40:38,079
You wish I was here.

525
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,284
Admit it, Eve.

526
00:40:40,285 --> 00:40:42,839
You wish I was here.

527
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,370
Admit it, Eve.

528
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,669
You wish I was here.

529
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,127
Admit it, Eve.

530
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,629
- You wish I was here.
- Oh...

531
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,949
Admit it, Eve.

532
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,089
You wish I was here.

533
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,929
Admit it, Eve.

534
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,053
You wish I was here.

535
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,670
Oh, God...

536
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:10,309
Oh...

537
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,650
Admit it, Eve.

538
00:41:26,665 --> 00:41:28,569
You wish I was here.

539
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,089
Admit it, Eve.

540
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,610
You wish I was here.

541
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,099
Admit it, Eve.

542
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,549
