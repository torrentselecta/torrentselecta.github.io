00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:08,087
<i>When Kat was 11 years old,</i>

3
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:10,967
<i>she went on a family vacation
to Sandals, Jamaica.</i>

4
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:17,221
I need help!
Someone get this jellyfish off me!

5
00:01:17,223 --> 00:01:21,143
<i>She quickly discovered
that she hated the ocean.</i>

6
00:01:29,193 --> 00:01:33,112
<i>Up until that moment,
Kat had a relatively good life.</i>

7
00:01:33,114 --> 00:01:35,281
<i>I mean, life wasn't amazing,</i>

8
00:01:35,283 --> 00:01:37,908
<i>but it's not like she fantasized
about killing herself.</i>

9
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:42,705
<i>It was good enough.
She was popular enough, smart enough.</i>

10
00:01:42,707 --> 00:01:46,627
<i>The only thing that was, like,
actually amazing was Daniel.</i>

11
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,090
<i>Daniel was like a dream, like, gorgeous,
like, really nice.</i>

12
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:57,597
<i>Like, the kind of boy that would text
her every night before bed and say...</i>

13
00:01:58,764 --> 00:02:02,099
<i>And the kind of boy that would meet
her outside of school every morning</i>

14
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:06,145
<i>just to make sure he could hold her
hand as they walked down the hall.</i>

15
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:09,106
<i>She could never figure out
why Daniel chose her,</i>

16
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:11,984
<i>what Daniel actually liked or loved
about her.</i>

17
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:14,695
<i>She just knew it felt really good.</i>

18
00:02:14,697 --> 00:02:18,409
<i>Whatever. It didn't matter.
It's better not to jinx these things.</i>

19
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,580
- Can I have another one?
- Sure.

20
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,791
<i>During her eight-day stay
on that stupid island,</i>

21
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:30,671
<i>Kat drank 72 virgin piña coladas.</i>

22
00:02:32,006 --> 00:02:34,217
<i>She was in heaven.</i>

23
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:40,097
<i>And then she got home.</i>

24
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,769
Oh, my God. What happened?

25
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:50,231
<i>When Kat had left for Jamaica,
she was 107 pounds,</i>

26
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:53,819
<i>when she returned,
she weighed in at whopping...</i>

27
00:02:55,238 --> 00:02:56,987
Get up!

28
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,324
<i>Despite being five-two,
which was tall for her age...</i>

29
00:03:00,326 --> 00:03:04,870
<i>her body was not prepared
to house the extra 20 pounds.</i>

30
00:03:04,872 --> 00:03:06,832
<i>It was noticeable.</i>

31
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:18,844
<i>Kat did her best
to minimize the fallout.</i>

32
00:03:25,977 --> 00:03:29,687
- You're wearing two sweatshirts?
- No.

33
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:32,731
<i>At least Daniel didn't make a big deal
out of it.</i>

34
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:36,610
<i>That's why she liked him. He didn't
care about what people thought.</i>

35
00:03:36,612 --> 00:03:39,780
<i>He liked her for whatever reasons
he liked her,</i>

36
00:03:39,782 --> 00:03:43,536
<i>and 20 stupid pounds
would never change that.</i>

37
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:47,415
<i>Until fourth period.</i>

38
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:56,964
<i>It wasn't even in Daniel's handwriting.</i>

39
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:59,010
<i>It was Kendra Sutherland's.</i>

40
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:06,223
<i>Whatever. Fuck her. Fuck him.</i>

41
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:09,101
<i>She didn't actually love Daniel.
She was 11.</i>

42
00:04:09,103 --> 00:04:12,855
<i>And when you're 11, you fall in love
with, like, everyone and everything.</i>

43
00:04:12,857 --> 00:04:14,398
<i>It's not real love.</i>

44
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,651
<i>Real love is when you can't exist
without someone,</i>

45
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:19,695
<i>when you'd rather die than be apart,</i>

46
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:22,156
<i>and the whole world goes dark,
and nothing else matters</i>

47
00:04:22,158 --> 00:04:23,824
<i>but the person standing
in front of you.</i>

48
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:27,411
I just want you to know I'm in.
I am all in.

49
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:30,623
For the first time in 140 years,

50
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,375
I felt something I thought
had been lost to me forever.

51
00:04:33,377 --> 00:04:36,045
<i>Say you'll wait for me.</i>

52
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:37,713
<i>We love each other.</i>

53
00:04:37,715 --> 00:04:41,342
<i>That's real love,
and those were real men.</i>

54
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:46,430
<i>Men who'd never leave her,
disappoint her, break her heart.</i>

55
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:49,727
<i>Real men whose love would spark
and ignite and inspire.</i>

56
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:58,400
<i>The summer before high school
she started writing fan fiction.</i>

57
00:04:58,402 --> 00:05:00,361
<i>By the year's end, she had become</i>

58
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:03,155
<i>one of the most prolific
smut writers on Tumblr.</i>

59
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:07,826
<i>She was known for her AU crossovers
and her consistent NC-17 ratings.</i>

60
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:11,705
<i>But what made her famous
was her story, "The First Night,"</i>

61
00:05:11,707 --> 00:05:14,458
<i>a 7,000-word fic
that was largely credited</i>

62
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,421
<i>with starting the "Larry Stylinson"
conspiracy theory.</i>

63
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,884
<i>That Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson
of One Direction were secretly fucking.</i>

64
00:05:23,886 --> 00:05:26,722
<i>"It's the first night
of the 'Take Me Home' tour."</i>

65
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:31,016
London, we've got
a little song for you tonight!

66
00:05:31,018 --> 00:05:33,227
<i>"Louis was unusually nervous.</i>

67
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:35,980
<i>His mouth was dry, palms sweating,</i>

68
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:39,817
<i>when suddenly, he felt the press
of Harry's body from behind.</i>

69
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:44,238
<i>"Harry can sense the nervous tension
"running through Louis's stiff body.</i>

70
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,156
- <i>'What are you doing?'</i>
- <i>'To calm your nerves.'</i>

71
00:05:46,158 --> 00:05:49,577
<i>"'You're my best mate, and this is
what mates do for one another.'</i>

72
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:54,000
- <i>'But Harry, what if someone sees?'</i>
- <i>'Let them.'</i>

73
00:05:58,254 --> 00:06:01,964
<i>"As Harry takes Louis into his
mouth with surprising ease,</i>

74
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:04,802
<i>he begins to suck his cock
with torturous finesse."</i>

75
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:36,290
Kat doesn't even have asthma.

76
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:38,961
She's just fat
and doesn't wanna exercise.

77
00:06:40,796 --> 00:06:44,381
<i>With 72 hours of publishing
"The First Night,"</i>

78
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:48,719
<i>it had garnered 184,265 notes,</i>

79
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:53,682
<i>and then three weeks later, Kat had
amassed over 53,000 followers.</i>

80
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:58,812
<i>She had become extremely popular...
online.</i>

81
00:06:58,814 --> 00:07:01,565
<i>No one in real life knew
that she was famous.</i>

82
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:04,735
Whomp, whomp, whomp,
whomp, whomp, whomp...

83
00:07:04,737 --> 00:07:09,281
<i>And no one online knew that her
life was actually super depressing.</i>

84
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:13,162
Ew! Take those things off.

85
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:19,583
<i>She'd regularly fantasize
about telling her followers</i>

86
00:07:19,585 --> 00:07:22,086
<i>how much she hated
her school, her town,</i>

87
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:25,756
<i>and how everyone in it was full
of shit and a fucking asshole.</i>

88
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:27,341
<i>She'd tell them to surround the school,</i>

89
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:30,012
<i>show up right after the morning bell
prepared for war.</i>

90
00:07:37,436 --> 00:07:40,729
<i>They'd demand the release
of their queen.</i>

91
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:42,483
<i>And if anyone even hesitated...</i>

92
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:51,949
<i>The scary thing is,
is they'd actually do it.</i>

93
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:55,286
<i>They'd do anything she asked.</i>

94
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:58,622
<i>That's how much they loved her.</i>

95
00:07:58,624 --> 00:08:04,547
<i>Granted, they didn't know who she was
or what she looked like.</i>

96
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:11,679
It's me, ThunderKitKat.

97
00:08:24,108 --> 00:08:28,819
<i>And then that video came out.
And they did see what she looked like,</i>

98
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:30,779
<i>and they still loved her.</i>

99
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:34,827
<i>And not only did they love her,
they wanted to fuck her.</i>

100
00:09:20,873 --> 00:09:23,624
Hey, I'm Rue. I'm an addict.

101
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:25,584
Hi, Rue.

102
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:28,548
And I've been clean for 60 days.

103
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:33,842
<i>For the record,
I'm not not telling the truth.</i>

104
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:36,136
<i>I've actually been doing really well.</i>

105
00:09:36,138 --> 00:09:38,055
<i>Because the morning after that whole</i>

106
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:40,891
<i>drug-dealer-face-tattoo
fentanyl excursion,</i>

107
00:09:40,893 --> 00:09:43,185
<i>I... got in a little bit of trouble...</i>

108
00:09:43,187 --> 00:09:46,313
Oh, shit.

109
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:49,694
<i>...for disappearing for like 16 hours.</i>

110
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:53,030
Where have you been?

111
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:58,617
- I'm sorry. My phone died.
- Bullshit. You're doing drugs.

112
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:01,036
- I'm not doing drugs.
- Then where have you been?

113
00:10:01,038 --> 00:10:02,788
And why weren't you answering
you phone?

114
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,124
- Why are you sneaking into the house?
- I was with someone.

115
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:07,376
- Who?
- It... It doesn't matter, Mom.

116
00:10:07,378 --> 00:10:09,461
It matters, Rue.

117
00:10:09,463 --> 00:10:12,172
It matters. You're doing drugs.

118
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:15,009
Gia, go back to sleep.

119
00:10:15,011 --> 00:10:18,762
- Rue, are you... are you okay?
- I'm fine. You can go back to sleep.

120
00:10:18,764 --> 00:10:22,727
She's okay, baby. Okay, go to bed.
Good night.

121
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:29,773
I will not allow you
to walk up into this house

122
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:32,401
at 5:30 in the morning
and lie to my face.

123
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:35,821
So tell me the truth right now.
Where were you?

124
00:10:35,823 --> 00:10:39,909
I don't want to have to tell you
everything that's going on in my life.

125
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:43,331
If you want to drug test me,
just drug test me.

126
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,043
<i>She wasn't the only person
upset with me.</i>

127
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:53,839
I'm not kidding, Rue. I'm not trying to
become best friends with someone

128
00:10:53,841 --> 00:10:56,385
who's gonna fucking kill themself.

129
00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:00,804
I know.

130
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:03,515
I didn't mean to do this.

131
00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:06,018
I've been through, like...

132
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,231
enough traumatic shit in my life
that I don't...

133
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:12,399
- I can't like...
- I get it.

134
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:14,612
I get it.

135
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:20,243
I don't want to be around you
if you don't stop using drugs.

136
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:27,291
Okay.

137
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:34,421
I mean it.

138
00:11:34,423 --> 00:11:38,384
I know. I'll stop.

139
00:11:38,386 --> 00:11:40,346
I promise.

140
00:11:41,556 --> 00:11:44,183
I just need you to do me a favor.

141
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:48,854
You're not gonna like it.

142
00:11:58,197 --> 00:12:00,990
You're still grounded
until I don't even fucking know.

143
00:12:00,992 --> 00:12:04,495
- What else is there?
- I told you I wasn't lying.

144
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:25,099
<i>So, I decided to stay clean.
And I have been, for a while.</i>

145
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:32,813
<i>But I've also been coming
to this meeting for longer.</i>

146
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:36,400
Girl, it's your 60 days today, right?

147
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:39,069
Ah! Oh, God. So good!

148
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:42,364
<i>Hmm, I don't know.
I just didn't want to depress anyone.</i>

149
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:46,994
<i>Plus, I really have been trying,
and that counts for something.</i>

150
00:12:46,996 --> 00:12:51,457
Two months ago,
I woke up from a comma.

151
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:53,709
I didn't know what happened,

152
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:58,214
but from the looks of my mother
and little sister's faces,

153
00:12:58,216 --> 00:13:00,382
I knew that...

154
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:03,095
whatever it was, whatever I did...

155
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,807
...it wasn't good.

156
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:14,480
It scared them.

157
00:13:14,482 --> 00:13:16,567
It really scared them.

158
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,490
And, at that moment,
I decided to at least try and change.

159
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:26,742
'Cause I owe it to them.

160
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:31,123
I owe it to everyone I love,
and everyone who loves me.

161
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:38,214
The hardest part, has been...

162
00:13:39,382 --> 00:13:42,843
...feeling like I owe it to myself.

163
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,266
And, maybe that'll get easier.

164
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:54,438
I hope it will. Thank you.

165
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,486
<i>I don't know. It's just been
a really weird couple of weeks.</i>

166
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:06,075
I didn't know it at the time,
but Jules was falling in love.

167
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:32,970
<i>I'm not saying I'm in love.</i>

168
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:37,433
I'm just saying I really,
really, really like him.

169
00:16:37,435 --> 00:16:41,562
- Who? ShyGuy118?
- His name is Tyler.

170
00:16:41,564 --> 00:16:43,856
It doesn't really matter.
They're both little fuckboy names.

171
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:48,152
He's not.
For real, like, he's so sweet.

172
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:51,322
- What school does he go to?
- St. Mary's.

173
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:54,283
Ew. Private school.

174
00:16:54,285 --> 00:16:56,619
You're just jealous.

175
00:16:56,621 --> 00:17:01,457
<i>Aside from that being a really shitty
thing to say, it's also not true.</i>

176
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:04,043
<i>She'd just been acting weird all week.</i>

177
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:05,920
I'm not jealous.

178
00:17:05,922 --> 00:17:09,131
I mean, you've been acting weird,
like, all week.

179
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:10,716
- What?
- Yeah, like,

180
00:17:10,718 --> 00:17:12,968
every time I'm on my phone,
you just stop talking.

181
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,347
- You're literally like my dad.
- Sorry.

182
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,184
It's fine.

183
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:22,104
You wanna see his dick?

184
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:51,634
<i>Stick it out!</i>

185
00:17:54,762 --> 00:17:56,637
<i>What a tiny twink!</i>

186
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:58,764
<i>Shut it. Just give it...</i>

187
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:01,060
What the fuck?

188
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:05,980
<i>Fucking step on it. It's too small,</i>

189
00:18:05,982 --> 00:18:09,942
- <i>It could never satisfy you.</i>
- Kat! Dinner!

190
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:11,821
I'll get her.

191
00:18:12,864 --> 00:18:15,197
Ay, Jesus, girl.

192
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:18,242
Kat! Hey!

193
00:18:18,244 --> 00:18:20,327
What?

194
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:23,916
Take pictures of your toes later.
Dinner's on the table.

195
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:32,091
Bye. Love you. See ya.

196
00:18:37,305 --> 00:18:41,140
I can't believe I haven't even told you,
how insane my parents are being.

197
00:18:41,142 --> 00:18:44,393
All week long,
she's just been going on and on...

198
00:18:44,395 --> 00:18:46,228
...about how much she hates my dad.

199
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,274
I'm just like, you can't do this to me.
He's my dad.

200
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:52,610
I don't know. I know
he has issues, but so does she.

201
00:18:52,612 --> 00:18:55,404
And he's not telling me shit about her.

202
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:58,657
Yeah. That's, like, not cool of your mom
to put you in that situation.

203
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:02,244
Yeah, but if I say that, then she's
gonna make me an enemy, too.

204
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:04,538
Literally the last thing
I need right now is...

205
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,957
Who keeps texting you?

206
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:09,168
- My dad.
- Well, do you want me to respond?

207
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:13,049
- He's texted you like 15 times.
- No, I'll just... call him later.

208
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:24,642
I mean, it's huge, right?

209
00:19:24,644 --> 00:19:27,519
- Mm...
- Don't front. It's a big dick.

210
00:19:27,521 --> 00:19:29,855
You know what?
It may be, but, we can't really tell,

211
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:31,482
'cause it's just fucking
floating in space.

212
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:34,485
- So?
- So, there's no way to compare scale.

213
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:36,904
If there's a fucking hand in
the frame, at least you can be,

214
00:19:36,906 --> 00:19:38,447
it's about the size
of an adult male hand.

215
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:41,408
Or like twice the size.
Or a fucking fraction of the size.

216
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,872
Rue. This is an objectively big dick.

217
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:51,921
Some people say that eyes
are the windows to the soul.

218
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:55,089
I disagree.

219
00:19:55,091 --> 00:19:58,219
I think it's your dick and how
you fucking photograph it.

220
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,266
There are two different types
of dick pics.

221
00:20:05,268 --> 00:20:08,310
Solicited, and unsolicited.

222
00:20:08,312 --> 00:20:11,814
Solicited makes up for about one percent
of all dick pics sent and received.

223
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:15,734
But within that one percent,
there are three categories.

224
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:17,862
Jules?

225
00:20:17,864 --> 00:20:21,448
Terrifying, horrifying,
and acceptable.

226
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,033
I know what some of you
are thinking.

227
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:26,495
Rue, terrifying and horrifying
sound like the same thing.

228
00:20:26,497 --> 00:20:30,918
Well, to a trained eye,
it could be the difference between...

229
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,716
Yo, sorry about the mess.
My mom's, like, out of town?

230
00:20:38,593 --> 00:20:40,136
A basic hygiene issue.

231
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:43,139
<i>Or...</i>

232
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,145
<i>...or a life or death situation.</i>

233
00:20:51,147 --> 00:20:52,899
So, here are some key things
to look out for.

234
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:58,946
Uncapped deodorant
touching the floor. Horrifying.

235
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:03,115
Jug of lotion.

236
00:21:03,117 --> 00:21:04,950
Terrifying.

237
00:21:04,952 --> 00:21:08,120
Dirty fingernails.

238
00:21:08,122 --> 00:21:10,706
Horrifying.

239
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,708
A medieval sword?

240
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,668
Run-for-your-fucking-life terrifying.

241
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:20,218
So, what constitutes this rarefied,
sought after, acceptable dick pic?

242
00:21:22,428 --> 00:21:24,720
Wow. Okay.

243
00:21:24,722 --> 00:21:28,392
So his penis is the size
of an Evian bottle.

244
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:32,394
- Well, the lighting is nice.
- Mm-hmm.

245
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:35,022
- His room looks clean.
- Mm-hmm.

246
00:21:35,024 --> 00:21:37,316
- Looks well-groomed.
- Right?

247
00:21:37,318 --> 00:21:39,777
Okay, yeah. I'm beginning
to understand the appeal.

248
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:41,612
Thank you.

249
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:43,364
But here's the thing.

250
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:46,575
I sent him a few pics from
the school bathroom during class.

251
00:21:46,577 --> 00:21:49,036
- Wait. Like, nudes?
- I can't talk about it.

252
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,415
- But I need your help.
- Yeah. Sure. Whatever.

253
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:57,378
I want, like, good,
professional partial nudes.

254
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,672
Like, classy, but not too arty.

255
00:21:59,674 --> 00:22:02,341
Like, like I took them
with very little thought or effort

256
00:22:02,343 --> 00:22:04,718
but could also be in fucking MOMA.

257
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,428
<i>Be cool, Rue.</i>

258
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,933
- Yeah. It's, like, easy. Whatever.
- Yeah.

259
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:17,316
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry.

260
00:22:18,651 --> 00:22:21,694
Hey. Look at you, still doing
the grapefruit diet.

261
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,529
Yep, I literally wanna die.

262
00:22:23,531 --> 00:22:25,823
Yeah. It's only bad
for the first two weeks.

263
00:22:25,825 --> 00:22:31,495
Then your stomach shrinks,
and you adjust, and you are reborn.

264
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:33,581
Oh, wow. Can't wait.

265
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:36,252
- How much?
- That'll be $3.25.

266
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:43,551
Yo, can you please,
maybe hurry the fuck up?

267
00:22:45,136 --> 00:22:47,219
Could I pay you the rest tomorrow?

268
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:51,307
- I'm sorry, baby. There's a policy.
- Hey, Kat, I, I gotcha.

269
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:54,602
- Oh, hi.
- Hey. How you doing?

270
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:57,271
- I'm good. How are you?
- Sweet. I'm good.

271
00:22:57,273 --> 00:22:59,857
- Hey, Erika. How much was it?
- $3.25.

272
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:02,610
I have, like, $1.25 here.

273
00:23:02,612 --> 00:23:04,945
Do you... For a grapefruit?

274
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:07,573
- Do you want something else to eat?
- Oh, no.

275
00:23:07,575 --> 00:23:09,491
No, 'cause if you don't have
enough money on you right now,

276
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:11,160
I can get you,
like, some actual food, or...

277
00:23:11,162 --> 00:23:15,416
She's doing the grapefruit diet.
It's not easy. Don't tempt her.

278
00:23:17,293 --> 00:23:19,376
Okay.

279
00:23:19,378 --> 00:23:21,629
Cool.

280
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:23,464
All right.

281
00:23:23,466 --> 00:23:25,925
- Thank you.
- Yeah, well...

282
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:30,471
- I'll see you in, biology.
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

283
00:23:30,473 --> 00:23:32,431
- Yeah. Sure.
- Goodbye.

284
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:34,266
- Aw, man, do it upright.
- Fuck it.

285
00:23:34,268 --> 00:23:36,938
- Aw, you got moked out.
- You suck, man.

286
00:23:40,942 --> 00:23:43,651
So you're basically
in a long-distance relationship.

287
00:23:43,653 --> 00:23:45,444
No, we like FaceTime every night.

288
00:23:45,446 --> 00:23:48,364
Aw, that's so sweet.
You guys are full-on in love.

289
00:23:48,366 --> 00:23:50,241
Oh, my God. Stop!

290
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:52,785
- I really like you.
- <i>I like you, too, Cassie.</i>

291
00:23:52,787 --> 00:23:54,664
I like you more.

292
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,165
We are not in love.

293
00:23:58,167 --> 00:24:00,376
But he did invite me
to spend the weekend with him.

294
00:24:00,378 --> 00:24:04,004
- Like, the whole weekend?
- Yeah, like Friday and Saturday night.

295
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:05,673
Wait, is your mom gonna let you go?

296
00:24:05,675 --> 00:24:08,842
It doesn't matter. I'll just kill her
in her sleep if she doesn't let me.

297
00:24:08,844 --> 00:24:13,015
- Sounds like true love to me.
- Whatever. She can't stop me.

298
00:24:14,141 --> 00:24:17,979
- Honestly, I love your mom...
- Yeah, well try living with her.

299
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,112
Do any of you guys
know how Bitcoin works?

300
00:24:28,114 --> 00:24:30,573
- Hmm. No.
- No.

301
00:24:30,575 --> 00:24:32,283
But you know who probably does?

302
00:24:32,285 --> 00:24:36,078
It's a worldwide cryptocurrency
and digital payment system.

303
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,289
I literally have no clue
what you're talking about.

304
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:41,750
Well, there's no easier way
to explain it.

305
00:24:41,752 --> 00:24:45,045
Look, why don't you just tell
us what you're trying to do,

306
00:24:45,047 --> 00:24:47,216
and we can tell you how we can help.

307
00:24:48,217 --> 00:24:51,927
- Unless it's human trafficking.
- I don't fuck with human trafficking.

308
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:55,389
I'm not... human trafficking.

309
00:24:55,391 --> 00:24:57,766
Yeah, us, neither.

310
00:24:57,768 --> 00:25:00,436
Okay.

311
00:25:00,438 --> 00:25:02,938
I was just wondering if it's like,

312
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,066
a good way to anonymously
get money online.

313
00:25:06,068 --> 00:25:08,736
That's literally what it's made for.

314
00:25:08,738 --> 00:25:10,323
Dumb ass.

315
00:25:11,532 --> 00:25:12,950
Cool.

316
00:25:16,162 --> 00:25:20,041
- I feel like that's it.
- No, it's good, it's good. I like it.

317
00:25:26,047 --> 00:25:28,380
Wait. Yeah, that really does
look like I took it.

318
00:25:28,382 --> 00:25:29,965
- Right?
- Okay.

319
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:31,636
- It's good.
- Yeah.

320
00:25:45,942 --> 00:25:47,900
- Got it.
- Do I look hot?

321
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:50,945
- Yeah.
- Hot enough that you'd want to fuck me,

322
00:25:50,947 --> 00:25:53,280
or like, cute?

323
00:25:53,282 --> 00:25:57,660
Like... like me?
Or like him, me?

324
00:25:57,662 --> 00:25:59,455
Either.

325
00:26:00,957 --> 00:26:02,540
Yeah.

326
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,708
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

327
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,380
Should I, like, show more? Like...

328
00:26:08,631 --> 00:26:11,799
- I don't know.
- What do you think?

329
00:26:11,801 --> 00:26:16,220
I... I mean, it's... whatever.
Whatever you, like to do.

330
00:26:16,222 --> 00:26:19,350
I mean, what do you think, though?

331
00:26:21,185 --> 00:26:22,853
...fuck.

332
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:27,022
It's my mom.

333
00:26:27,024 --> 00:26:30,444
Hey, Mom.
I'm just at Jules's house.

334
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:38,284
Well I have NA tonight.
So, like nine-thirty-ish?

335
00:26:38,286 --> 00:26:41,914
Okay. love you, too. Bye.

336
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:46,750
- NA?
- Yeah.

337
00:26:46,752 --> 00:26:49,420
Narcotics anonymous.

338
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:52,923
Wait. You've been clean
for like, two weeks, right?

339
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:55,593
- Yeah. That's right.
- Rue!

340
00:26:55,595 --> 00:26:57,970
- What?
- Fuck you, come here!

341
00:26:57,972 --> 00:27:01,726
- What?
- You've been... Come here! Oh, my God!

342
00:27:07,356 --> 00:27:09,899
I'm so proud of you.

343
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:13,279
<i>I've never met anyone
in my entire life like Jules.</i>

344
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:22,745
I'm gonna go get
a glass of water really quick.

345
00:27:22,747 --> 00:27:24,957
- Okay.
- Whatever, bitch.

346
00:27:50,775 --> 00:27:52,777
<i>Oh, fuck me.</i>

347
00:27:53,778 --> 00:27:56,280
Fuck.

348
00:28:15,883 --> 00:28:18,259
- I gotta go. But, love you.
- Okay.

349
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:20,010
And I'll see you later.

350
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:21,554
- Bye.
- Love you.

351
00:28:21,556 --> 00:28:23,516
Love you, too.

352
00:29:18,404 --> 00:29:23,157
<i>And, at that moment, I decided
to at least try and change.</i>

353
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:26,827
'Cause I owe it to them.

354
00:29:26,829 --> 00:29:31,624
I owe it to everyone I love
and everyone that loves me.

355
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:34,962
And, maybe... that'll get easier.

356
00:29:37,048 --> 00:29:41,010
I hope it will. Thank you.

357
00:30:01,906 --> 00:30:05,783
Yo. Sixty days, no small feat.

358
00:30:05,785 --> 00:30:07,868
Thanks.

359
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,665
- Very moving share.
- Thank you.

360
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,295
Can I ask you something?
How'd you survive that OD?

361
00:30:20,258 --> 00:30:23,719
- What do you mean?
- Somebody had to save your life, right?

362
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,182
- It was my sister.
- Aw, man.

363
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:32,103
- Older or younger?
- Younger.

364
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:36,440
- I have to get home, so...
- Like 12, 13?

365
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:42,570
- I don't really understand what the...
- Curiosity.

366
00:30:42,572 --> 00:30:44,947
Yeah. She was 13.

367
00:30:44,949 --> 00:30:47,950
That's some heavy shit. But, hey.

368
00:30:47,952 --> 00:30:50,578
We've all done some bad shit
in our lives, right?

369
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,746
Comes with the territory.

370
00:30:52,748 --> 00:30:57,042
But, man, now you just got me
thinking about...

371
00:30:57,044 --> 00:31:00,504
what that does to a 13-year-old,
a 13-year-old kid,

372
00:31:00,506 --> 00:31:02,967
who finds her big sister overdosed.

373
00:31:03,926 --> 00:31:06,135
What that moment
must do to somebody...

374
00:31:06,137 --> 00:31:08,762
how it affects
the rest of their lives, you know,

375
00:31:08,764 --> 00:31:11,599
how it affects their ability to trust.

376
00:31:11,601 --> 00:31:16,186
Leaves it hard for them to get close
to people, you know, relationships.

377
00:31:16,188 --> 00:31:19,106
Makes it hard for them to fall in love.

378
00:31:19,108 --> 00:31:21,901
Living with the fear
that at any moment,

379
00:31:21,903 --> 00:31:25,821
the rug can be ripped out from under
them, and they lose everything.

380
00:31:25,823 --> 00:31:28,866
Especially the people
that they love.

381
00:31:28,868 --> 00:31:33,037
You ever think about that?
Yeah, probably fucked up for life.

382
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,999
But, hey, you're gonna have
to make peace with that.

383
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:38,834
Just like you're gonna have
to make peace with the fact

384
00:31:38,836 --> 00:31:40,961
that you could be responsible
for some shit like that,

385
00:31:40,963 --> 00:31:42,713
and then get up in front
of a whole group of people

386
00:31:42,715 --> 00:31:44,340
who are struggling
with the same issues,

387
00:31:44,342 --> 00:31:48,054
and lie about being clean.
You know what I'm saying?

388
00:31:50,514 --> 00:31:54,185
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Listen, young blood.

389
00:31:57,355 --> 00:32:00,940
You're playing pool
with Minnesota Fats.

390
00:32:00,942 --> 00:32:03,234
Who is Minnesota Fats?

391
00:32:03,236 --> 00:32:06,195
The greatest motherfucking pool player
that ever lived.

392
00:32:06,197 --> 00:32:08,155
Okay.

393
00:32:08,157 --> 00:32:10,076
I'm Ali.

394
00:32:12,328 --> 00:32:15,204
Let me know when you want
to stop trying to kill yourself

395
00:32:15,206 --> 00:32:17,208
and eat some pancakes.

396
00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:36,102
<i>How was NA today?</i>

397
00:32:38,938 --> 00:32:41,647
It was good. I...

398
00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:44,733
celebrated 60 days today.

399
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:48,114
- I'm really proud of you, Rue.
- Thanks.

400
00:32:57,915 --> 00:33:00,835
- Hey.
- Hey.

401
00:33:02,587 --> 00:33:06,924
- Whatcha doin'?
- Watching <i>My So-Called Life.</i>

402
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:11,760
- Fuckin' Jordan Catalano.
- I know, right?

403
00:33:11,762 --> 00:33:13,431
Right.

404
00:33:20,396 --> 00:33:24,023
Please promise me you will never fall
for a Jordan Catalano.

405
00:33:24,025 --> 00:33:26,235
But he's so cute.

406
00:33:30,198 --> 00:33:32,698
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
It's okay.

407
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,203
Okay.

408
00:33:43,044 --> 00:33:45,211
Hey.

409
00:33:45,213 --> 00:33:47,171
Hello.

410
00:33:47,173 --> 00:33:49,759
Oh, shit. No!

411
00:33:51,093 --> 00:33:52,929
Oh.

412
00:33:54,347 --> 00:33:56,265
Okay.

413
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:05,356
<i>Kit... KittenKween?</i>

414
00:34:05,358 --> 00:34:09,443
- <i>Hi.</i>
- <i>Hi. I'm really excited to meet you.</i>

415
00:34:09,445 --> 00:34:13,405
<i>I've seen you dance in that video,
like, a hundred times.</i>

416
00:34:13,407 --> 00:34:16,242
- Really?
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i> I love your confidence.

417
00:34:16,244 --> 00:34:18,786
<i>Well, Jesus fucking Christ,
you've gotta be one of the most</i>

418
00:34:18,788 --> 00:34:21,830
<i>beautiful creatures I've ever seen.</i>

419
00:34:21,832 --> 00:34:23,666
I don't...
I don't know about that, but...

420
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:27,211
<i>No, I'm serious. I'm not even
joshing you. I mean... Jesus.</i>

421
00:34:27,213 --> 00:34:30,714
<i>But, I am gonna warn you.</i>

422
00:34:30,716 --> 00:34:32,969
<i>I'm kind of... I'm kind of an odd duck.</i>

423
00:34:36,138 --> 00:34:40,057
<i>I mean, I'm serious.
I got some extreme kinks.</i>

424
00:34:40,059 --> 00:34:42,893
- Okay.
- <i>But, I'm real gentle.</i>

425
00:34:42,895 --> 00:34:45,020
- <i>You wanna see something?</i>
- Sure.

426
00:34:45,022 --> 00:34:48,192
- <i>It's kind of embarrassing.</i>
- Why?

427
00:34:57,493 --> 00:34:59,618
- <i>Well, what are you laughing at?</i>
- Oh, no...

428
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,871
<i>Have you ever seen
a penis this small before?</i>

429
00:35:01,873 --> 00:35:04,290
Oh, my God. No, no, no.
It's not small.

430
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:07,001
- <i>Don't lie to me.</i>
- I... I'm not lying.

431
00:35:07,003 --> 00:35:10,337
- I'm not lying.
- <i>Tell me that you'd never fuck me.</i>

432
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:15,259
- Wait. What?
- <i>Tell me that you'd never fuck me.</i>

433
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:16,802
<i>That I'm a pathetic loser.</i>

434
00:35:16,804 --> 00:35:20,180
<i>And I could never satisfy some
beautiful princess like you.</i>

435
00:35:20,182 --> 00:35:23,100
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

436
00:35:23,102 --> 00:35:29,940
- <i>Come on, tell me you'd never fuck me.</i>
- I wouldn't. I really wouldn't.

437
00:35:29,942 --> 00:35:32,443
- <i>Tell me I'm a loser.</i>
- Are you crying?

438
00:35:32,445 --> 00:35:34,989
<i>Tell me I'm a pathetic loser
with a baby dick.</i>

439
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:40,409
- <i>Yeah, keep making fun of me.</i>
- Wait.

440
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:43,579
- You want me to make fun of you?
- <i>Oh, yes, KittenKween.</i>

441
00:35:43,581 --> 00:35:45,541
<i>Come on. It turns me on.</i>

442
00:35:49,086 --> 00:35:52,046
I mean, I mean, your dick is,
like, really, really small.

443
00:35:52,048 --> 00:35:54,465
- <i>How small is it?</i>
- Like, medically small.

444
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:57,134
Like, really tiny,
and I can barely see it.

445
00:35:57,136 --> 00:35:59,136
<i>I know. I'm pathetic.</i>

446
00:35:59,138 --> 00:36:01,263
And no woman would ever fuck you,
because you're a big,

447
00:36:01,265 --> 00:36:03,474
disgusting piece of shit!

448
00:36:03,476 --> 00:36:06,185
<i>I am! I am!</i>

449
00:36:06,187 --> 00:36:08,729
<i>Keep laughing at me!
Keep laughing at me!</i>

450
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:11,232
- <i>Tell me to stop touching it.</i>
- Please stop touching it.

451
00:36:11,234 --> 00:36:13,776
You're gonna make me throw up.
Stop it!

452
00:36:13,778 --> 00:36:15,361
<i>Okay, okay. Okay, I'm sorry.</i>

453
00:36:15,363 --> 00:36:18,280
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry, KittenKween.
I'm sorry.</i>

454
00:36:18,282 --> 00:36:21,283
So you...
so you'd do anything I tell you?

455
00:36:21,285 --> 00:36:24,411
- <i>KittenKween, I'd do anything you want.</i>
- Why?

456
00:36:24,413 --> 00:36:27,706
<i>Because you're big,
and beautiful, and powerful, and...</i>

457
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:29,625
<i>I want you to take
complete control of me.</i>

458
00:36:29,627 --> 00:36:31,754
<i>I want you to tell me...</i>

459
00:36:31,963 --> 00:36:35,297
<i>when I can come,
and when I can't come.</i>

460
00:36:35,299 --> 00:36:37,967
<i>And I want you to punish me
when I cheat.</i>

461
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:41,887
- Punish you, like, how?
- <i>I want you to fine me.</i>

462
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:44,265
- Wait. Like, like, money?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

463
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:46,519
<i>I wanna be your cash pig.</i>

464
00:36:48,104 --> 00:36:51,689
<i>But Kat didn't actually, like,
believe him.</i>

465
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:55,568
<i>Until... three days later
when she got a message.</i>

466
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,653
I wanna look cute, but not eager.

467
00:36:57,655 --> 00:36:59,699
Then don't wear that top.

468
00:36:59,907 --> 00:37:02,575
This? I thought it looked good.

469
00:37:02,577 --> 00:37:05,538
I don't really know
if I like this body suit, though.

470
00:37:11,294 --> 00:37:16,714
<i>And within minutes, $100 in Bitcoin
was transferred to her.</i>

471
00:37:16,716 --> 00:37:19,425
What are you looking at?

472
00:37:19,427 --> 00:37:23,345
Nothing. Just this, article.

473
00:37:23,347 --> 00:37:25,141
About what?

474
00:37:26,183 --> 00:37:29,101
You know, like... the Holocaust.

475
00:37:29,103 --> 00:37:31,022
Oh. Cool.

476
00:37:32,899 --> 00:37:35,401
- Love that.
- Like, perf.

477
00:37:36,694 --> 00:37:40,112
- Lex?
- It's cute.

478
00:37:40,114 --> 00:37:42,158
I wish I had your collar bones.

479
00:37:44,702 --> 00:37:47,286
I'm putting a lot of trust into you.

480
00:37:47,288 --> 00:37:50,873
- Yeah, Cassie, don't get pregnant.
- That's not funny, Kat.

481
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:53,500
But don't you dare get pregnant.

482
00:37:53,502 --> 00:37:55,544
Relax, Mom. He has a roommate.

483
00:37:55,546 --> 00:37:58,297
I want you to keep your phone on
throughout the night.

484
00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:00,674
You send me a photo
when you get back to the dorm

485
00:38:00,676 --> 00:38:04,261
- ...with a clock in it.
- Like a ransom photo?

486
00:38:04,263 --> 00:38:07,223
- I hate you.
- Well, I love you.

487
00:38:07,225 --> 00:38:09,268
I love you, too.

488
00:38:11,062 --> 00:38:13,397
Have fun, baby girl.

489
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:19,360
No funny business, Christopher!

490
00:38:19,362 --> 00:38:22,698
- Yeah, no, I promise.
- Yeah, just be a gentleman.

491
00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:28,037
And don't you dare get pregnant.

492
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:45,012
- That was amazing.
- I know.

493
00:39:23,676 --> 00:39:25,761
Oh, my God. Fuck.

494
00:39:28,723 --> 00:39:31,432
Hey, my mom called. I gotta go.

495
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:33,978
- Okay, I love you. Bye.
- Love you, too.

496
00:39:52,205 --> 00:39:55,249
- Out of my way, dick.
- Okay, bitch.

497
00:39:57,418 --> 00:40:00,586
This is, like, the craziest party
I've ever been to.

498
00:40:00,588 --> 00:40:02,296
I just want to make it
through initiation.

499
00:40:02,298 --> 00:40:04,884
You will.

500
00:40:09,722 --> 00:40:12,556
Kill the fucking music!

501
00:40:12,558 --> 00:40:14,934
Kill the fucking music!

502
00:40:14,936 --> 00:40:19,813
All right, listen up, bitches!
We got some fresh meat up in here.

503
00:40:19,815 --> 00:40:23,319
I want all your pledgie faggots
up against the wall!

504
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,322
- Don't lose, bitch!
- Fuck you, bitch! Drink this shit!

505
00:40:28,324 --> 00:40:31,619
- Woo!
- Last one to finish gets stripped naked.

506
00:40:35,706 --> 00:40:37,583
Go, McKay!

507
00:40:39,252 --> 00:40:41,420
Woo!

508
00:40:42,505 --> 00:40:46,050
Yeah! Yeah! Woo!

509
00:40:54,183 --> 00:40:55,766
Woo!

510
00:40:55,768 --> 00:40:57,812
Yo! Strip that faggot!

511
00:41:06,404 --> 00:41:09,655
- Is it still alive?
- Of course it's still fucking alive.

512
00:41:09,657 --> 00:41:11,325
Fuck that, dude.

513
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,788
I don't know, dude.

514
00:41:25,506 --> 00:41:27,923
Follow my lead.

515
00:41:27,925 --> 00:41:31,093
Oh!

516
00:41:31,095 --> 00:41:35,474
McKay brought the baddest bitch
in the fucking game, yo!

517
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,150
<i>This is so depressing.</i>

518
00:42:50,967 --> 00:42:53,511
- What's up?
- What's up, Kat?

519
00:43:00,601 --> 00:43:02,562
- Hey.
- What's up?

520
00:43:07,483 --> 00:43:10,236
Mm... received. All right.

521
00:43:14,448 --> 00:43:18,576
Twenty, 40, 60, 80, 100.

522
00:43:18,578 --> 00:43:20,997
Twenty, 40, and 60.

523
00:43:22,123 --> 00:43:25,958
- One-sixty?
- Twenty percent banking fee.

524
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,712
Fine.

525
00:43:29,005 --> 00:43:31,382
Pleasure doing business with you.

526
00:43:34,427 --> 00:43:39,138
Do you think people are 100
percent straight? 100 percent gay?

527
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:44,351
No, 'cause obviously there's, like,
bi people, asexual, pan...

528
00:43:44,353 --> 00:43:48,898
- Sexuality is, like, a spectrum.
- Yeah. Totally.

529
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,235
- Why?
- I don't know.

530
00:43:54,864 --> 00:43:58,240
Do you think straight guys
ever, like, watch gay porn?

531
00:43:58,242 --> 00:44:00,576
Not if they're
a hundred percent straight.

532
00:44:00,578 --> 00:44:02,328
You just said it's a spectrum.

533
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:06,040
Yeah, on either side of the spectrum
is gay and straight.

534
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:08,292
I fucking hate this.

535
00:44:08,294 --> 00:44:13,505
- Is this about Nate?
- No. He's, like, super straight.

536
00:44:13,507 --> 00:44:15,925
- Is it about your dad?
- No.

537
00:44:15,927 --> 00:44:19,637
- It would explain why they're fighting.
- It's not about any guy that I know.

538
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:25,517
All I know is that most guys are, like,
weird, gross, and fucking pathetic.

539
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:27,186
Okay, look, if I tell you something,

540
00:44:27,188 --> 00:44:30,064
you swear on your fucking life
you won't say a word?

541
00:44:30,066 --> 00:44:31,817
Yeah.

542
00:44:39,242 --> 00:44:41,617
Hey.

543
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:43,911
You're home.

544
00:44:43,913 --> 00:44:45,498
Thanks for the weekend.

545
00:44:51,254 --> 00:44:54,674
- I love you.
- I love you more.

546
00:45:06,936 --> 00:45:08,811
Sorry, we're about to close.

547
00:45:08,813 --> 00:45:11,313
Oh, just...
I want to try a few things on.

548
00:45:11,315 --> 00:45:14,193
Okay. Be quick.

549
00:45:30,793 --> 00:45:33,045
Hey.

550
00:45:34,338 --> 00:45:37,425
- Can I ask your opinion on something?
- Yeah, sure.

551
00:45:40,553 --> 00:45:42,555
How does this look?

552
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,695
Yo! You hear me?
I said we're about to close.

553
00:45:59,655 --> 00:46:01,655
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

554
00:46:01,657 --> 00:46:05,242
- I just wanted to buy these.
- Cool.

555
00:46:05,244 --> 00:46:07,328
You live around here?

556
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,330
- No, no.
- No, word.

557
00:46:09,332 --> 00:46:12,627
- This place sucks.
- Yeah.

558
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:17,465
- I'll ring you up.
- Okay.

559
00:47:14,105 --> 00:47:16,438
Ooh. You look different.

560
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,649
What?

561
00:47:18,651 --> 00:47:20,695
You look different.

562
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:23,739
I changed.

563
00:47:31,831 --> 00:47:34,498
Rue!

564
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,042
- Hey.
- Guess what?

565
00:47:37,044 --> 00:47:39,420
What?

566
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:41,672
Okay, well, actually, first,

567
00:47:41,674 --> 00:47:45,634
you are the best soft-core
pornographer in the game.

568
00:47:45,636 --> 00:47:47,428
So thank you.

569
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:51,181
And second... Tyler wants to meet.

570
00:47:51,183 --> 00:47:53,350
- Like, for real?
- Yeah.

571
00:47:53,352 --> 00:47:54,894
- In, like, person?
- Yeah.

572
00:47:54,896 --> 00:47:57,062
That's cool. Where?

573
00:47:57,064 --> 00:47:59,440
- The lake.
- When?

574
00:47:59,442 --> 00:48:02,318
On Saturday, after the carnival.

575
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:07,239
- Like at... at night?
- Of course. Yeah.

576
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:11,493
That doesn't...
seem, like, a little weird?

577
00:48:11,495 --> 00:48:14,788
No. Sis, you watch
way too much <i>Dateline.</i>

578
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:18,751
Relax, like, he's our age. It's fine.

579
00:48:18,753 --> 00:48:21,545
Jules, you don't think that maybe...

580
00:48:21,547 --> 00:48:25,799
you should like meet him
at the carnival, like, in public?

581
00:48:25,801 --> 00:48:28,886
I mean, we can't, like...

582
00:48:28,888 --> 00:48:32,932
He's a jock.
His mom is super conservative.

583
00:48:32,934 --> 00:48:34,516
It's, like, a tough situation.
It doesn't work.

584
00:48:34,518 --> 00:48:37,478
Honestly, Jules, I don't really
care about the situation,

585
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,271
because it just doesn't seem safe.

586
00:48:39,273 --> 00:48:42,066
I've been in situations
that are way less safe. Like...

587
00:48:42,068 --> 00:48:44,068
Okay, but that's not
really the point, right?

588
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:47,446
The point is, it's dangerous.

589
00:48:47,448 --> 00:48:50,991
Rue, this is the difference
between, like, you and me. Like...

590
00:48:50,993 --> 00:48:53,035
I don't always get the privilege
of meeting people

591
00:48:53,037 --> 00:48:56,497
in front of a fucking audience.
People here know I'm trans...

592
00:48:56,499 --> 00:48:58,374
That doesn't mean that you
have to meet this dude

593
00:48:58,376 --> 00:49:00,876
at a fucking deserted lake
in the middle of nowhere.

594
00:49:00,878 --> 00:49:03,089
Okay? It seems insane.

595
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:08,968
Out of everyone in the world,
I wanted to tell you.

596
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:12,555
'Cause I thought you'd be happy.

597
00:49:12,557 --> 00:49:14,225
But fuck it.

598
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:08,152
- Hey, Rue.
- Hey, is Jules here?

599
00:50:08,154 --> 00:50:10,404
- Yeah, she's upstairs.
- Can I...

600
00:50:10,406 --> 00:50:12,615
- Of course. Come on.
- Okay.

601
00:50:12,617 --> 00:50:15,453
Jules, Rue's here!

602
00:50:27,548 --> 00:50:29,467
Hey.

603
00:50:31,135 --> 00:50:33,886
I don't want to fight with you.

604
00:50:33,888 --> 00:50:36,265
I don't want to fight with you, either.

605
00:50:42,855 --> 00:50:46,315
You have to understand that
I just want you to be safe, okay?

606
00:50:46,317 --> 00:50:50,029
I just, I don't want anything
bad to happen to you.

607
00:50:52,323 --> 00:50:54,573
And, you know,
you just can't be mad at me

608
00:50:54,575 --> 00:50:56,575
for wanting you to be okay.

609
00:50:56,577 --> 00:50:59,245
You can say I'm being anxious,
you know?

610
00:50:59,247 --> 00:51:01,330
Just...

611
00:51:01,332 --> 00:51:04,542
It hurts my heart too much. And...

612
00:51:04,544 --> 00:51:07,920
- It just, I...
- I'm not mad at you.

613
00:51:07,922 --> 00:51:10,172
You're the best thing that's happened
to me in a really long time,

614
00:51:10,174 --> 00:51:12,633
and I just don't want...

615
00:51:12,635 --> 00:51:15,719
anything bad to happen, so please
don't be mad at me.

616
00:51:15,721 --> 00:51:18,182
- Just don't be mad.
- I'm sorry.

617
00:51:21,185 --> 00:51:23,477
I get it.

618
00:51:23,479 --> 00:51:25,729
I love you.

619
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:28,232
I really do.

620
00:51:28,234 --> 00:51:30,069
I love you, too.

621
00:51:39,912 --> 00:51:43,583
- You're a mess, you know that?
- So are you.

622
00:51:49,797 --> 00:51:53,134
I hate everyone else in the world
but you.

623
00:52:04,437 --> 00:52:07,815
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I should go.

624
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,610
Fuck!

625
00:52:22,121 --> 00:52:24,997
- Who is it?
- Rue: <i>It's me. Open the door.</i>

626
00:52:24,999 --> 00:52:26,834
Fuck.

627
00:52:29,503 --> 00:52:33,047
Not today, Rue. I'm sorry.

628
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:36,300
- Come on, man. Don't be a dick.
- Nah, I'm serious.

629
00:52:36,302 --> 00:52:38,802
You can't come in.

630
00:52:38,804 --> 00:52:42,264
Look, man...
All I need is just, like, a few OCs.

631
00:52:42,266 --> 00:52:44,266
Sorry, I can't help you.

632
00:52:44,268 --> 00:52:46,852
Fez, I've had a really
fucked up day, all right?

633
00:52:46,854 --> 00:52:49,063
It's been a really fucked up day.

634
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:51,815
So I need you to open the door
for me, okay?

635
00:52:51,817 --> 00:52:54,403
I'm not gonna help you
kill yourself, Rue.

636
00:52:56,739 --> 00:53:00,908
I'm sorry, but, you can't be coming
over here no more.

637
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:03,577
- Just go home.
- Don't... Fez!

638
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:05,871
Don't close the... Fuck!

639
00:53:05,873 --> 00:53:09,041
Fez, open the fucking door, please?

640
00:53:09,043 --> 00:53:12,670
I'm begging you just to open the door.

641
00:53:12,672 --> 00:53:15,464
Fez! You're full of shit, man.

642
00:53:15,466 --> 00:53:18,634
You make your living off
of selling drugs to teenagers.

643
00:53:18,636 --> 00:53:22,471
Now all of a sudden, you want to
have a fucking moral high ground?

644
00:53:22,473 --> 00:53:25,849
You're a fucking dropout drug dealer.
You know that?

645
00:53:25,851 --> 00:53:30,980
You're a fucking drug dealer with seven
functioning fucking brain cells.

646
00:53:30,982 --> 00:53:33,025
Open the door!

647
00:53:34,193 --> 00:53:38,404
Fuck you! Fuck you, Fez. Okay?

648
00:53:38,406 --> 00:53:40,656
Are you doing this because you care
about me?

649
00:53:40,658 --> 00:53:43,242
If you gave a shit about me,
you wouldn't have sold me

650
00:53:43,244 --> 00:53:45,744
the fucking drugs
in the first place!

651
00:53:45,746 --> 00:53:48,956
But you did! You fucking did!

652
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:51,959
So open the goddamned door!

653
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:53,669
Open the door!

654
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:56,505
- I can't do it, Rue. I'm sorry.
- Open the door!

655
00:53:56,507 --> 00:53:58,676
Open the door!

656
00:53:59,886 --> 00:54:01,846
Open the door.

657
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:07,224
You did this to me!

658
00:54:07,226 --> 00:54:10,646
You fucking... you did this to me, Fez.

659
00:54:12,815 --> 00:54:15,441
You fucking ruined my life!

660
00:54:15,443 --> 00:54:19,820
The least you could do is open
the goddamned door and fix it!

661
00:54:19,822 --> 00:54:23,199
I'm fucking serious.
I'm so fucking serious.

662
00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:27,286
If you don't open this door right now,
I swear to God,

663
00:54:27,288 --> 00:54:30,374
I will hate you,
till the day I fucking die.

664
00:54:33,669 --> 00:54:35,087
