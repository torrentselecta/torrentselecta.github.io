<i>Sometimes, when I get really high,
I kind of think I'm psychic.</i>

3
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:16,502
<i>When Nate Jacobs was 11 years old,</i>

4
00:01:16,504 --> 00:01:19,630
<i>he found his dad's porn collection.</i>

5
00:01:19,632 --> 00:01:22,174
<i>His dad, Cal, was obsessive.</i>

6
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,469
<i>His mom always said
that's who he got it from.</i>

7
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:27,888
<i>Then he quickly realized
that the colored cases</i>

8
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,265
<i>and placement were no accident.</i>

9
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:36,522
<i>It was an elaborate code,
that no one fucked with his shit.</i>

10
00:01:36,524 --> 00:01:39,858
<i>I have a very pretty dick.
Do you want to see it?</i>

11
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,404
<i>What do you like to be called?
Mister? Master?</i>

12
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:48,993
- <i>Daddy?</i>
- <i>For you? You can call me "Daddy."</i>

13
00:01:48,995 --> 00:01:53,791
<i>Open wider. Wider.
More like that.</i>

14
00:01:55,793 --> 00:01:57,668
- <i>Yeah!</i>
- <i>Good?</i>

15
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,378
<i>Yes, Daddy. I'll be good.</i>

16
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,380
<i>Every video was basically the same.</i>

17
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:04,008
<i>Oh, you are all woman, aren't you?</i>

18
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,051
- <i>Mostly.</i>
- <i>Mostly.</i>

19
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:08,220
<i>They'd drink, make small talk...</i>

20
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:11,726
<i>Oh, don't make me come.
I... I want to wait for that.</i>

21
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,102
<i>...and then his dad would
fuck the shit out of some...</i>

22
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:18,566
<i>Fucking whore.
Fucking slut.</i>

23
00:02:56,187 --> 00:02:58,564
I want to talk to you.

24
00:03:04,111 --> 00:03:06,572
You're a strong man, Nathaniel.

25
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:11,327
I knew it from the moment
you were born.

26
00:03:13,037 --> 00:03:16,666
You have an... iron will...

27
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,834
...drive, determination.

28
00:03:20,836 --> 00:03:23,879
I've always admired that in you.

29
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:26,467
Because some day, it will
lead you to greatness.

30
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:37,810
But no one in this world
will ever root for you.

31
00:03:37,812 --> 00:03:41,605
They'll see what I see
and they'll despise you for it.

32
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:45,734
Sometimes you'll know,
and sometimes you won't.

33
00:03:45,736 --> 00:03:49,240
But the farther you go,
the sharper their blade.

34
00:03:50,408 --> 00:03:53,285
Just don't ever
give them an opening.

35
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:06,171
<i>By 12, he had adopted a rigid
diet and workout schedule.</i>

36
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:11,804
<i>Within a year, his body fat
dropped from 23% to 6%.</i>

37
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:37,911
Ready? All right!

38
00:04:37,913 --> 00:04:41,206
<i>He joined the football team
as a freshman and quickly excelled.</i>

39
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:45,252
Red... Red, 32, hut!

40
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:47,129
<i>By the year's end,</i>

41
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:50,799
<i>he was not only the starting
quarterback, but the team captain.</i>

42
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:52,843
Keep it together, Nate.
Stay focused.

43
00:04:52,845 --> 00:04:55,181
All right, let's fucking go!

44
00:05:08,194 --> 00:05:11,111
<i>He loved the crowds,</i>

45
00:05:11,113 --> 00:05:15,159
<i>the cheers, the feeling of winning.</i>

46
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:21,455
<i>But he hated being
in the locker room.</i>

47
00:05:21,457 --> 00:05:25,586
<i>He hated how casual how his teammates
were about being naked...</i>

48
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,256
<i>...how they'd talk to him
with their dicks hanging out.</i>

49
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:34,385
<i>He made a concerted effort
to always maintain eye contact</i>

50
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:36,220
<i>during these exchanges.</i>

51
00:05:36,222 --> 00:05:37,805
<i>Every now and then, he'd forget,</i>

52
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:39,975
<i>and accidentally catch
a glimpse of someone's penis.</i>

53
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:59,284
<i>His older brother Aaron
was a fuck-up.</i>

54
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:02,663
<i>He could tell his dad didn't like Aaron,
didn't think he had guts or brains</i>

55
00:06:02,665 --> 00:06:05,376
<i>or half a fucking clue
and Nate agreed.</i>

56
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:11,338
<i>He didn't talk to his dad that much,
but they didn't need to.</i>

57
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,841
<i>They had a good relationship.</i>

58
00:06:13,843 --> 00:06:17,845
<i>He didn't like his mother either.
She was weak, and a pushover.</i>

59
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:20,639
<i>Plus, she didn't
take care of herself.</i>

60
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:22,474
<i>He made a long mental checklist</i>

61
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:25,477
<i>of the things he liked
and disliked about women.</i>

62
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:28,772
<i>He liked tennis skirts
and jean cut-offs,</i>

63
00:06:28,774 --> 00:06:31,150
<i>but not the kind so short
you could see the pockets.</i>

64
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:33,652
<i>He liked ballet flats and heels.</i>

65
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:35,612
<i>He hated sneakers and dress shoes.</i>

66
00:06:35,614 --> 00:06:39,366
<i>But was fine with sandals as long as
they were worn with a fresh pedicure.</i>

67
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:42,077
<i>He liked thigh gaps, hated cankles.</i>

68
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,873
<i>He liked tan lines, long necks,
slender shoulders.</i>

69
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:49,752
<i>He liked good posture
and fruit-scented body mist.</i>

70
00:06:49,754 --> 00:06:52,880
<i>He liked full lips, and small noses.</i>

71
00:06:52,882 --> 00:06:55,007
<i>He liked chokers, but the lacy ones</i>

72
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:57,676
<i>with flower cutouts
or delicate patterns.</i>

73
00:06:57,678 --> 00:07:02,723
<i>He hated girls who sat like boys,
talked like boys, acted like boys.</i>

74
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:07,813
<i>But there was nothing on planet Earth
he hated more than body hair.</i>

75
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:13,233
<i>That's one of the first things
he noticed about Maddy.</i>

76
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:14,987
<i>She was basically hairless.</i>

77
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:22,368
<i>He'd walk her home
from school every day.</i>

78
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,330
<i>Made him feel good to know
that he was there to protect her.</i>

79
00:07:26,332 --> 00:07:29,583
<i>He knew the world was full of
men who wanted to hurt Maddy.</i>

80
00:07:29,585 --> 00:07:34,213
<i>Men who hang out the windows of their
cars and scream obscenities at her.</i>

81
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:37,508
<i>College guys who wouldn't
think twice about drugging her.</i>

82
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,095
<i>Lonely guys who'd spot her
at a mall.</i>

83
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:46,266
<i>Men who'd rape her, torture her,
sell her into sexual slavery.</i>

84
00:07:46,268 --> 00:07:48,854
<i>He didn't even
like to think about it.</i>

85
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:55,361
<i>He did, however, like to thing about
the things he'd do to protect her.</i>

86
00:07:58,072 --> 00:08:01,115
If anyone ever tried to
hurt you, I'd kill them.

87
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:04,036
You're, like, the sweetest guy ever.

88
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:09,665
<i>He also liked
that Maddy was a virgin,</i>

89
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:12,793
<i>that no guy had ever
put his penis in her.</i>

90
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:16,797
- You're a virgin?
- Yeah.

91
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:20,092
- Like, fully?
- Yeah.

92
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:21,846
What about like...

93
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:27,184
- Have you ever been fingered?
- Only my own.

94
00:08:30,604 --> 00:08:34,982
<i>He sometimes imagined marrying
Maddy and starting a family.</i>

95
00:08:34,984 --> 00:08:37,443
<i>He knew he didn't want boys, though.</i>

96
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:40,072
<i>But he also didn't like
the idea of having girls.</i>

97
00:08:41,741 --> 00:08:44,950
<i>Plus, Maddy could be a real bitch.</i>

98
00:08:44,952 --> 00:08:49,204
<i>Like that night at McKay's party,
something just flipped.</i>

99
00:08:49,206 --> 00:08:52,543
<i>And he knew he had anger issues,
but, I mean, so did every guy.</i>

100
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,007
<i>It's not like that was anything in
his life he could trace it back to.</i>

101
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:04,513
<i>It was just... who he was,
and who he'd always be.</i>

102
00:09:14,857 --> 00:09:16,982
What are you doing?

103
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:20,780
Nothing, I just came to...
came to say goodnight.

104
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:29,872
- Good night.
- Good night.

105
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,534
<i>It was the first day of school,
and my heart was racing.</i>

106
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:16,166
<i>I made a new best friend and for the
first time since getting out of rehab,</i>

107
00:10:16,168 --> 00:10:19,338
<i>I was feeling good about the world.</i>

108
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:23,050
<i>I've got an idea.</i>

109
00:10:24,218 --> 00:10:29,096
- What?
- Wanna get high?

110
00:10:29,098 --> 00:10:33,267
- What is it?
- No idea.

111
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:37,481
- Didn't you just get out of rehab?
- Yeah.

112
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:42,192
- Should I be concerned?
- Maybe.

113
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:47,450
- I feel like this isn't a good idea.
- I kinda disagree.

114
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:54,206
Rue.

115
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:06,594
Do you feel anything?

116
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,936
Do you feel anything?

117
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:20,731
Rue, what's wrong?

118
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:23,986
Just so happy.

119
00:11:31,202 --> 00:11:33,329
<i>I know you're
not allowed to say it...</i>

120
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:39,335
<i>...but drugs are kind of cool.</i>

121
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,258
<i>I mean, they're cool
before they wreck your skin...</i>

122
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:49,635
<i>...and your life...</i>

123
00:11:49,637 --> 00:11:52,346
Can you grab me a towel?

124
00:11:52,348 --> 00:11:54,640
<i>...and your family.</i>

125
00:11:54,642 --> 00:11:58,143
Gia, I need you to grab me a towel.

126
00:11:58,145 --> 00:12:00,813
I found her down.
I gave her one dose of Narcan...

127
00:12:00,815 --> 00:12:03,859
<i>That's when they get uncool.</i>

128
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:11,325
<i>It's actually a very
narrow window of cool.</i>

129
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:23,168
I'll wait with you
until your mother comes home.

130
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,212
You want to watch some TV?

131
00:12:25,214 --> 00:12:29,258
<i>And once you pass through
that window of cool...</i>

132
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:34,348
This is embarrassing.
I feel like everyone knows.

133
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:40,185
Rue, I don't want to turn
this into a competition,

134
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:45,190
but, like, I win.
For, like, a multitude of reasons.

135
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:47,943
I just... I don't want to deal with
all the fucking questions.

136
00:12:47,945 --> 00:12:50,281
I still win.

137
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,871
Wait, you're alive?

138
00:12:58,873 --> 00:13:01,584
Like, what the fuck?

139
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:06,086
Oh, shit, that's the girl who tried
to commit suicide at McKay's.

140
00:13:06,088 --> 00:13:08,213
- Wait, what?
- Oh, yeah. I forgot.

141
00:13:08,215 --> 00:13:11,300
You guys both was fuckin'.

142
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:13,721
Why does everybody
think we fucked?

143
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:18,682
<i>Now Maddy knew
she had an optics issue,</i>

144
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:21,685
<i>along with a mountain
of evidence against her.</i>

145
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:24,857
<i>So, last night,
while texting with Nate...</i>

146
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:29,028
<i>...Maddy had an idea.</i>

147
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:41,372
- Alcohol is not good for me.
- So you did fuck him.

148
00:13:41,374 --> 00:13:45,042
- Honestly, I think I blacked out.
- For real?

149
00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:47,086
Maddy!

150
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:50,047
- Hey, you.
- Oh, look! It's our new sexpert!

151
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:52,841
- Congratulations, bitch!
- Welcome to the club!

152
00:13:52,843 --> 00:13:55,260
<i>Now, when Kat told BB
she lost her virginity</i>

153
00:13:55,262 --> 00:13:58,180
<i>to some dude whose name
she didn't remember, she knew</i>

154
00:13:58,182 --> 00:14:02,017
<i>she'll tell Maddy and Cassie, and
the rest of the fucking planet Earth.</i>

155
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:04,353
<i>But that was kind of the point.</i>

156
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:07,817
<i>She was just relived
that it was no longer a thing.</i>

157
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:28,627
Hey, I'm Ethan.

158
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:32,216
- Please don't be a mass shooter.
- What?

159
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:36,510
Sorry, it's just, like, the
first thing that came to mind.

160
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:41,181
Oh, my God.
Am I giving off shooter vibes?

161
00:14:41,183 --> 00:14:42,808
- Yeah.
- Really?

162
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,477
- Eh, you know.
- Shit.

163
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:49,314
Look, I don't know. What's
your Reddit username?

164
00:14:49,316 --> 00:14:51,694
Um, it's IncelUprising.

165
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,949
I'm joking. A joke.

166
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:04,955
- I'm Kat.
- Uh, I'm Ethan.

167
00:15:04,957 --> 00:15:07,541
Yeah, you said that.

168
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:12,421
Okay, listen up, everybody.
Welcome to Biology 301.

169
00:15:12,423 --> 00:15:15,883
So, let's start with
a little improvisation.

170
00:15:15,885 --> 00:15:17,718
I'd like each of you to get up

171
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,057
and tell us a five-minute story
about your summer.

172
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,768
Looks like we have
our first volunteer: Rue.

173
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,561
Please don't do this to me.

174
00:15:27,563 --> 00:15:31,025
Come on, everyone. Let's give
her a little encouragement.

175
00:15:54,757 --> 00:15:56,298
A memory?

176
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,595
Anything that had
an impact on you this summer.

177
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:06,227
I don't... I don't...
I can't think of...

178
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:13,693
Just... relax your body.
Release the tension.

179
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:18,278
And just breathe.

180
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,284
We recommend taking her directly
to the rehabilitation center.

181
00:16:28,374 --> 00:16:32,712
- So this... this summer?
- Yes.

182
00:16:53,983 --> 00:16:56,861
Let's go.

183
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:06,327
I'm having trouble, like, remembering
something, you know.

184
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:10,289
Just tell us a specific memory.

185
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,916
Uh, okay. Uh...

186
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:16,628
I was, um, with my mom,
and my, uh, my little sister,

187
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,176
and we were, uh,
listening to this... this song.

188
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:38,444
I know you know this song.

189
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,253
Are you doing drugs in my house?
Are you doing drugs in my house?

190
00:18:39,255 --> 00:18:41,132
What are you doing?

191
00:18:45,636 --> 00:18:47,886
I'm not joking!

192
00:18:47,888 --> 00:18:50,347
I need to...
I need to go!

193
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:53,142
- Dad's so fucking proud, Mom.
- Oh, really?

194
00:18:53,144 --> 00:18:56,270
Dad's so fucking proud.

195
00:18:56,272 --> 00:18:57,896
Get off of me!

196
00:18:57,898 --> 00:18:59,773
- I don't give...
- Get off of me!

197
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:04,155
Back the fuck up. Back the fuck up and
let me out of this fucking house.

198
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:11,305
I'm sorry, but I...
I can't think of anything, so...

199
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:15,976
Just...

200
00:20:17,895 --> 00:20:21,814
I'm, uh... I'm done. I can't.

201
00:20:21,816 --> 00:20:24,525
- Do I have to do this?
- She's a mess, dude.

202
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:29,073
- Honestly, I bet it's brain damage.
- You're being fucking rude.

203
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,020
Fuck.

204
00:21:03,983 --> 00:21:06,944
Rue, it's me.

205
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:13,699
- Are you okay?
- You are so fucking stupid, Lexi.

206
00:21:13,701 --> 00:21:15,784
- Why?
- 'Cause I already flushed everything

207
00:21:15,786 --> 00:21:17,369
down the fucking toilet.

208
00:21:17,371 --> 00:21:18,912
Well, I just came to check on you.

209
00:21:18,914 --> 00:21:22,875
I don't want you to fucking check on me,
whether I'm fine or I'm not fine.

210
00:21:22,877 --> 00:21:26,211
What difference are you going to make?
Are you going to give me a life advice?

211
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:30,299
- You gonna fucking help me?
- Well, you're one of my best friends.

212
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:33,969
Give me a fucking break. 'Cause we
went to fucking pre-school together?

213
00:21:33,971 --> 00:21:36,807
That does not make us
best fucking friends.

214
00:21:38,142 --> 00:21:40,559
You say all this,
but what happens in three days

215
00:21:40,561 --> 00:21:44,313
when you knock on my door asking
me to piss in some Tylenol bottle?

216
00:21:44,315 --> 00:21:46,190
What, you're gonna say the opposite?

217
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:49,193
How we've known each other since
pre-school and we're best friends?

218
00:21:49,195 --> 00:21:52,529
It's like you have
a split personality disorder.

219
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:55,201
Sorry if I miss the old you.

220
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:07,546
I slept like shit, too.
Yeah, I miss you.

221
00:23:19,243 --> 00:23:24,121
- My name is Ali, and I'm an addict.
- Hi, Ali.

222
00:23:24,123 --> 00:23:26,415
Actually, an addict
is a nice word for it.

223
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:29,793
I was a stone-cold crackhead.

224
00:23:29,795 --> 00:23:34,173
I was also a firefighter, so I thought,
the two might cancel each other out.

225
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:38,721
As long as I saved lives, I was well
within my right to destroy my own.

226
00:23:40,264 --> 00:23:43,349
The problem was, I was...

227
00:23:43,351 --> 00:23:47,146
I was also a father,
to two young girls.

228
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:52,107
My girls live in Texas.

229
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:57,782
I speak to them whenever I can.
Drugs can take away a lot.

230
00:24:00,117 --> 00:24:03,496
<i>The first time
I tried Oxycontin, I was 13.</i>

231
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:07,625
What do these feel like?

232
00:24:10,544 --> 00:24:13,047
They're the absolute worst.

233
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:17,299
<i>I used to take care
of my dad after school</i>

234
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:20,721
<i>had to take a second
job to cover the medical bills.</i>

235
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,643
<i>A state-issued nurse would come
by every day for two hours,</i>

236
00:24:27,645 --> 00:24:31,732
<i>and she'd, legit, just play
Candy Crush on her phone.</i>

237
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:38,072
<i>But, anyway, the point is,
he had, like, a bunch of pills.</i>

238
00:25:21,157 --> 00:25:24,700
<i>He was too out of it
to know I was high.</i>

239
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:28,078
And I always have
the best time with you.

240
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,333
Me, too.

241
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:33,669
Do you mind?!

242
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:44,178
Hey. Uh, I'm gonna need you
to do me a big favor.

243
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,472
You see, there are
a bunch of these meetings

244
00:25:46,474 --> 00:25:51,602
that I was supposed to attend
that I didn't actually attend, so...

245
00:25:51,604 --> 00:25:55,191
I'm gonna need you
to backdate this slip.

246
00:25:58,694 --> 00:26:02,198
Yeah. Ethically, that's a line
I will not cross.

247
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,458
What if I, uh... suck your dick?

248
00:26:18,631 --> 00:26:21,757
Like, in my car?

249
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,054
I'm 17, you fucking creep.
Sign the slip.

250
00:26:32,978 --> 00:26:36,899
- Pleasure doing business with you.
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

251
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:48,786
Rue.

252
00:26:50,663 --> 00:26:54,667
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

253
00:27:28,784 --> 00:27:31,120
Um, I'm gonna be right back.

254
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,459
Fuck, yeah.

255
00:27:37,752 --> 00:27:39,503
Fucking slut.

256
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,886
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck...

257
00:27:59,023 --> 00:28:04,026
<i>She never admitted it,
and no one could ever prove it,</i>

258
00:28:04,028 --> 00:28:05,946
<i>but we all knew it was her.</i>

259
00:28:27,718 --> 00:28:32,515
<i>Or, I don't know, I guess for Kat,
it probably felt like we all knew.</i>

260
00:28:34,225 --> 00:28:37,059
<i>That's the weird thing
about the Internet.</i>

261
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:39,647
<i>Ten people can feel like
the whole world.</i>

262
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,862
Meet me in the cafeteria in
five minutes. We need to talk.

263
00:28:48,864 --> 00:28:50,866
Why?

264
00:28:52,326 --> 00:28:56,078
Listen, Kat. I didn't do anything.
I told Roy not to post it.

265
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,290
It doesn't matter, okay? He's still
sending it to people and saying it's me.

266
00:29:00,292 --> 00:29:02,459
Look, I don't want
my life to be ruined,

267
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:05,087
and I'm sure you don't want to
end up on a sex offender list.

268
00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:09,842
- Kat, you know I'm not a sex offender.
- It's child pornography, you dumb fuck.

269
00:29:09,844 --> 00:29:13,387
But we're all under 18. Children
can't make child pornography.

270
00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:17,349
- Troy, google it.
- I'm not googling child pornography.

271
00:29:17,351 --> 00:29:21,437
You know what? Fuck it. Fuck
it, I'm going to the police.

272
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:25,733
All right! Okay. Okay, okay, I get it.
What do you need?

273
00:29:25,735 --> 00:29:28,402
First, for you to delete the video off
your phone...

274
00:29:28,404 --> 00:29:31,280
- ...and whoever's phone you sent it to.
- That is done.

275
00:29:31,282 --> 00:29:35,367
And for you to tell Wes to tell
everybody that it's not me. Okay?

276
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:39,248
Okay. Done.
Anything else?

277
00:29:40,624 --> 00:29:42,249
Actually, yeah.

278
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:45,711
<i>So even though Roy and Troy
tried to put an end to it,</i>

279
00:29:45,713 --> 00:29:49,214
Kat? Nah.
It was some other bitch.

280
00:29:49,216 --> 00:29:52,634
Oh, dude. What the fuck?
I thought you said it was Kat.

281
00:29:52,636 --> 00:29:55,179
I did, but, I mixed that bitch up.

282
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:57,975
<i>By the end of the week...</i>

283
00:30:10,905 --> 00:30:13,781
<i>Katherine Hernandez, please report
to the principal's office.</i>

284
00:30:13,783 --> 00:30:16,659
<i>Katherine Hernandez
to the principal's office.</i>

285
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:19,161
<i>I heard a very disturbing rumor.</i>

286
00:30:19,163 --> 00:30:22,539
- About what?
- There is a recording of you

287
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:26,418
engaged in... sexual activity.

288
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:32,007
Or something to that effect, that is
being shared amongst the students.

289
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:35,177
Is this about that video of that
girl getting banged from behind?

290
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:38,889
Because no, it's not me, but...
just out of sheer curiosity,

291
00:30:38,891 --> 00:30:41,600
what could have possibly
led you to believe that is was?

292
00:30:41,602 --> 00:30:45,437
I just want to be clear that I haven't
personally seen the video...

293
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:48,232
It is because the girl in the
video is fat, Principal Hayes?

294
00:30:48,234 --> 00:30:51,110
I'm not jumping
to conclusions, Katherine...

295
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:53,946
I'd just appreciate it if everyone would
stop talking to me like it was,

296
00:30:53,948 --> 00:30:57,950
because, frankly, it's... offensive.

297
00:30:57,952 --> 00:31:00,202
You know, it's one thing for my
classmates to body shame me,

298
00:31:00,204 --> 00:31:05,791
but for you, Principal Hayes
that's just... a whole nother thing.

299
00:31:05,793 --> 00:31:09,503
It's degrading.
It's... discriminatory.

300
00:31:09,505 --> 00:31:12,339
And it just goes to show
how insidious, and...

301
00:31:12,341 --> 00:31:16,218
systemic body terrorism
truly is in this country.

302
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,762
From my own principal.

303
00:31:18,764 --> 00:31:23,517
Well, I'm... I'm...
I... I can't apologize enough.

304
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,978
And I give you my word,

305
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,151
I will do everything in my power
to put an end to this rumor.

306
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:33,319
Thank you, Principal Hayes.

307
00:31:33,321 --> 00:31:35,487
<i>And so on the same way
that mass shootings,</i>

308
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:37,865
<i>sex scandals,
and stolen elections do,</i>

309
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:41,201
<i>the whole thing blew over pretty quickly
and we all moved on to the next thing.</i>

310
00:31:41,203 --> 00:31:43,203
- <i>You guys pumped?</i>
- <i>Yeah!</i>

311
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:46,373
- Are we gonna win?
- Yeah!

312
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:51,172
Then let's hear it for the
East Highland Blackhawks!

313
00:32:01,724 --> 00:32:03,893
Yeah, Nate!

314
00:32:36,676 --> 00:32:38,761
Hey, let's go!

315
00:32:42,431 --> 00:32:46,266
I, 100 percent,
do not feel safe right now.

316
00:32:46,268 --> 00:32:49,520
No. So stay
the fuck out of my grill.

317
00:32:49,522 --> 00:32:52,648
- Yo, Maddy.
- What?

318
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:56,988
- Let me take you out tonight.
- Why?

319
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:02,743
- I hate you.
- I know.

320
00:33:04,704 --> 00:33:06,912
Seriously?

321
00:33:06,914 --> 00:33:09,039
Seriously?

322
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:11,417
Seriously.

323
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:15,337
- I'm over it.
- Rue!

324
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:18,007
Breathing is clearly not
a priority to you.

325
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:20,261
- Ding, ding, ding!
- I see. Oh...

326
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:27,057
Fuck.

327
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:29,810
Uh, you wanna come over
for dinner tonight?

328
00:33:29,812 --> 00:33:34,690
I wish. But my dad wants to have like
a capital F, capital D Family Dinner.

329
00:33:34,692 --> 00:33:37,318
Which is weird, because it's
literally just me and him

330
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,572
eating dinner together,
like, every single night.

331
00:33:41,741 --> 00:33:43,866
Well, um, what about later?

332
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:48,078
I'm probably gonna do some homework.
Binge-watch some <i>Madoka Magica.</i>

333
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,540
Okay, well, um,
maybe you could, like,

334
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:55,629
come over Sunday night, 'cause my
mom's, like, asking me and stuff.

335
00:33:58,257 --> 00:34:01,300
Are you talking
to your momma about me?

336
00:34:01,302 --> 00:34:04,513
No. Shut up.

337
00:34:09,143 --> 00:34:11,729
- Bye, Rue.
- Bye.

338
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:17,652
<i>I'm such a loser.</i>

339
00:34:40,549 --> 00:34:43,177
Maddy, I just want to say
that I'm sorry.

340
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:00,903
Cash or credit?

341
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:16,583
- Christopher McKay.
- Yep.

342
00:35:16,585 --> 00:35:19,753
Drove down from college
for the weekend.

343
00:35:19,755 --> 00:35:21,298
Yep.

344
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:26,552
So, what's in store
for Friday night, huh?

345
00:35:26,554 --> 00:35:29,140
Uh, you know.
Just... mm.

346
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,977
Cassie's smitten like
a kitten with you.

347
00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:38,230
Yeah?
Yeah, she's a pretty cool girl.

348
00:35:38,232 --> 00:35:41,817
Well, I tell ya, it's not
easy to hold her attention.

349
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:45,154
Uh-uh. Like mother,
like daughter.

350
00:35:45,156 --> 00:35:49,742
But she's a good girl.
She's got a good heart.

351
00:35:49,744 --> 00:35:51,787
Yeah. Handle with care.

352
00:35:53,456 --> 00:35:57,124
- I will.
- Mom, stop talking to him.

353
00:35:57,126 --> 00:35:59,501
Excuse me.
I've been dismissed.

354
00:35:59,503 --> 00:36:03,507
You have fun.
Ooh, you look so pretty.

355
00:36:05,801 --> 00:36:08,846
Hey. Want to watch a movie?

356
00:36:10,598 --> 00:36:12,725
Yeah, come on.

357
00:36:18,105 --> 00:36:21,607
Maddy. Why don't you let me
take you out tonight?

358
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:24,487
I don't know.
Text me.

359
00:36:54,558 --> 00:36:59,230
All right.
No cell phones during dinner.

360
00:37:03,484 --> 00:37:07,277
I don't think I have an attention
span for real life anymore.

361
00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:09,865
Shut up, you smart ass.

362
00:37:37,935 --> 00:37:40,021
<i>Hey, open the door!</i>

363
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:46,819
- What do you want?
- <i>Open the fucking door.</i>

364
00:37:51,824 --> 00:37:54,033
- Yo, who is it, man?
- <i>Rue.</i>

365
00:37:54,035 --> 00:37:57,036
No, bro, tell her to
come back later. Yo.

366
00:37:57,038 --> 00:37:59,872
- Too late, bitch.
- Hold on, hold on.

367
00:37:59,874 --> 00:38:02,291
- You can be in here right now.
- I see you, cash money.

368
00:38:02,293 --> 00:38:05,753
- Nah, nah.
- I need some some OCs and some socks.

369
00:38:05,755 --> 00:38:08,297
I can't help you
right now. You gotta go.

370
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:11,175
Yo, for real, Rue. I ain't fuckin'
playing with you. Come on.

371
00:38:11,177 --> 00:38:13,510
- You can't be in here.
- Look, Fez,

372
00:38:13,512 --> 00:38:16,430
I'm fucking drenched.
Okay?

373
00:38:16,432 --> 00:38:21,685
And, uh... I'm out of drugs. So...
Don't be a dick.

374
00:38:21,687 --> 00:38:24,104
Oh, my God.
That's not my fucking problem.

375
00:38:24,106 --> 00:38:25,981
You gotta get up
out of my house right now

376
00:38:25,983 --> 00:38:27,775
before these motherfuckers
come through.

377
00:38:27,777 --> 00:38:30,861
All I need is a couple OCs,
and some Xannies.

378
00:38:30,863 --> 00:38:32,905
That's all
I need, and I can be gone.

379
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:36,075
Yo, I'm trying to tell you, I
don't got shit right now. Like...

380
00:38:36,077 --> 00:38:38,827
Come back in a few hours,
I got you, whatever you need.

381
00:38:38,829 --> 00:38:41,705
But right now, you gotta get
the fuck up outta my house.

382
00:38:41,707 --> 00:38:43,415
I know you have something, Fez.

383
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:46,835
I'm just telling you, I don't
got shit for you, Rue, come on.

384
00:38:46,837 --> 00:38:49,088
I need you out the house right now.

385
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,340
My guy's about to come through here.
I don't want you here

386
00:38:51,342 --> 00:38:53,217
when he gets here, you understand?

387
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:56,679
- Give me drugs.
- This is dead serious.

388
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:58,516
Yo, Rue.

389
00:39:12,446 --> 00:39:15,491
I could fucking kill you right now.

390
00:39:18,744 --> 00:39:21,163
Yo, Ash, they're here.

391
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:34,508
Look, I'm serious, Rue.

392
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:38,721
Just stay right there, keep
your mouth shut, and be cool.

393
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:41,348
These dudes ain't fucking around.

394
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:44,476
<i>Now, I'm not gonna lie. That's when
I started to get a little scared.</i>

395
00:39:44,478 --> 00:39:47,940
<i>I mean, I'm all good with drugs
until guns start coming out.</i>

396
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:55,172
<i>Coming out of East Highland,
I've held the state record</i>

397
00:40:55,174 --> 00:40:57,383
for most receiving yards
the last two years in row.

398
00:40:57,385 --> 00:40:59,301
I broke East Highland records
for the most receptions,

399
00:40:59,303 --> 00:41:01,345
the most yards
during the game: 112,

400
00:41:01,347 --> 00:41:03,555
most yards per catch,
most yards after the catch.

401
00:41:03,557 --> 00:41:06,141
And I can fucking block.

402
00:41:06,143 --> 00:41:08,352
And this coach is acting like
he don't want to start me.

403
00:41:08,354 --> 00:41:11,939
Like I haven't earned my due on the
field or something. That's bullshit.

404
00:41:11,941 --> 00:41:14,191
Don't they do that to,
like, all the freshmen?

405
00:41:14,193 --> 00:41:19,198
I'm not all freshman. Look at my stats.
Shit pisses me off. I don't get it.

406
00:41:23,202 --> 00:41:26,745
- You want to kill him?
- What?

407
00:41:26,747 --> 00:41:29,083
Let's fucking kill him.

408
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:35,170
Cass, I'm serious.

409
00:41:35,172 --> 00:41:37,297
It's not funny. This motherfucker
really pissed me off.

410
00:41:37,299 --> 00:41:41,178
Come on, McKay.
It just takes time.

411
00:41:48,185 --> 00:41:52,898
I thought about you all week.
I'm dying to fuck you.

412
00:41:56,235 --> 00:41:59,405
Why you gotta make
everything so sexual?

413
00:42:01,365 --> 00:42:03,075
What?

414
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:08,622
I'm trying to have a real-ass
conversation with you.

415
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:12,626
I'm... I'm sorry.

416
00:42:18,674 --> 00:42:21,344
It's cool, Cassie.
It's all right.

417
00:42:37,777 --> 00:42:42,615
- So this your little bitch?
- Nah, bruh, that's my little sister.

418
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:47,662
Well, hello, there, little sis.

419
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:52,206
<i>Now, when Fez said
his dudes were coming over,</i>

420
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:55,834
<i>I didn't think his dude
would be this dude.</i>

421
00:42:55,836 --> 00:42:59,421
My name is Mouse.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

422
00:42:59,423 --> 00:43:03,384
<i>But you know, that's what happens
when you hang out with drug dealers.</i>

423
00:43:03,386 --> 00:43:05,346
Yo, Custer, toss me that bag.

424
00:43:06,764 --> 00:43:08,555
All right, check it.

425
00:43:08,557 --> 00:43:13,519
I got a 100 OP-OC 80s,
500 Xanny bars, 500 20s of Addy.

426
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:16,146
I'm low on Vikes, so if
you wanna cop some Vikes,

427
00:43:16,148 --> 00:43:18,565
you better cop 'em today,
'cause I got, like, 50 left.

428
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:22,736
I got a quap of that Cali
medicinal, and an ounce of Molly.

429
00:43:22,738 --> 00:43:27,408
- Custer, what's the math on that?
- Uh, 25, 15, and 1,100,

430
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:32,581
35, 77, and 25...
7,750.

431
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,840
Here.

432
00:43:43,092 --> 00:43:47,177
- Sure you don't want no Fentanyl?
- Nah, man, I'm cool off that shit.

433
00:43:47,179 --> 00:43:50,639
There's too many ODs,
and I don't want the heat.

434
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:54,059
How about you, little sis?
You ever try Fentanyl?

435
00:43:54,061 --> 00:43:57,148
- No.
- No, she's good, bruh.

436
00:43:58,774 --> 00:44:01,734
Gonna let big brother talk for you?

437
00:44:01,736 --> 00:44:05,738
- I don't know.
- Don't look at him. Look at me.

438
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,742
You ever try it?

439
00:44:08,951 --> 00:44:12,786
Yo, for real, bruh. I don't want
her fucking with that shit.

440
00:44:12,788 --> 00:44:14,663
You know that feeling
when you come so hard

441
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:17,084
that you can't feel or hear shit?

442
00:44:19,712 --> 00:44:23,505
- You like that feeling?
- Yeah.

443
00:44:23,507 --> 00:44:26,969
Well, shit.
You gonna love this.

444
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:35,684
I'm... I'm good, actually.

445
00:44:35,686 --> 00:44:40,189
- What, you don't trust me?
- Yo, for real, man. She's good.

446
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:44,735
Shut the fuck up, bitch.
Ain't nobody talkin' to you.

447
00:44:44,737 --> 00:44:48,072
Tell your big brother I'm not
talking to him right now.

448
00:44:48,074 --> 00:44:50,741
Tell him,
"Shut the fuck up."

449
00:44:50,743 --> 00:44:54,495
Come on. Don't be scared.
It's not gonna bite you.

450
00:44:54,497 --> 00:44:56,582
Come on. Try it.

451
00:45:04,548 --> 00:45:06,717
Oh, just try it.

452
00:45:09,178 --> 00:45:11,762
<i>Dear God, I know I've been a cunt
for, like, a lot of my life,</i>

453
00:45:11,764 --> 00:45:15,933
<i>and my family
and I am so, so, so sorry, but...</i>

454
00:45:15,935 --> 00:45:18,644
<i>just please, God, I'm begging you,</i>

455
00:45:18,646 --> 00:45:22,149
<i>do not let me die tonight.</i>

456
00:45:41,502 --> 00:45:44,628
- Welcome home.
- Fuck!

457
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:47,881
- What the fuck, man?
- Hi, Tyler.

458
00:45:47,883 --> 00:45:51,301
What the fuck are you doing here, man?
Get the fuck out of my apartment.

459
00:45:51,303 --> 00:45:54,138
If you're looking for the
kitchen knives, they're here.

460
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,726
Same with the baseball bat
from your room.

461
00:45:59,729 --> 00:46:01,897
Who the fuck are you, man?

462
00:46:03,399 --> 00:46:06,485
I'm the boyfriend of the girl
that you raped on Saturday night.

463
00:46:08,988 --> 00:46:11,822
No, no. Dude, what the fuck?
I wouldn't rape anyone.

464
00:46:11,824 --> 00:46:15,409
I swear to God,
I didn't rape a girl, dude.

465
00:46:15,411 --> 00:46:17,619
But I saw it.

466
00:46:17,621 --> 00:46:22,126
- You saw what?
- I saw you rape her in the pool.

467
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:29,465
Wait a minute. You're talking about that
crazy chick that was at the party?

468
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:33,385
That chick was asking me to.
I was the one that was saying no.

469
00:46:33,387 --> 00:46:36,555
- She was blacked out.
- Dude, she wasn't blacked out, man.

470
00:46:36,557 --> 00:46:40,644
I swear to God, she asked me to fuck
her, like, right here, right now.

471
00:46:42,021 --> 00:46:44,273
Do you know how old she is?

472
00:46:46,984 --> 00:46:50,361
- She's like, 18.
- Try 17.

473
00:46:50,363 --> 00:46:54,950
- Fuck, dude, she didn't say that to me.
- And how old are you?

474
00:46:56,327 --> 00:46:58,077
- I'm like, 21.
- You're 22.

475
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,871
- I mean, barely.
- You turned 22 five months ago, Tyler.

476
00:47:00,873 --> 00:47:03,957
Don't fucking lie to me.

477
00:47:03,959 --> 00:47:07,963
So, not only did you rape a
girl, but you raped a minor.

478
00:47:09,715 --> 00:47:11,590
- I'm gonna hurt you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

479
00:47:11,592 --> 00:47:14,426
Yeah, and you're not gonna press
charges, because if you do,

480
00:47:14,428 --> 00:47:17,471
you're gonna go to jail
for a lot longer than I will...

481
00:47:17,473 --> 00:47:20,307
- Please.
- ...depending on what I do to you.

482
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:22,935
Please, please, please, I am
begging you, please don't do this.

483
00:47:22,937 --> 00:47:25,437
Dude, don't hurt me, please.
Don't do this.

484
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:28,065
- Get on your knees.
- What?

485
00:47:28,067 --> 00:47:30,567
Get on your knees.

486
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:33,864
- No. I'm not... -
- Hey, get on your knees. Come on.

487
00:47:35,658 --> 00:47:39,203
Did you seriously think you could rape
a girl and nobody would do anything?

488
00:47:42,748 --> 00:47:47,209
Oh, my God. Fuck!
I didn't do anything, man!

489
00:47:47,211 --> 00:47:49,338
I'm gonna ask you a question.

490
00:47:53,175 --> 00:47:56,385
- Did you rape her?
- No.

491
00:47:56,387 --> 00:47:59,138
- Did you rape her?
- No! Fuck!

492
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:01,598
Did you rape her?

493
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,434
- Admit it! Did you rape her?
- Fucking ow!

494
00:48:03,436 --> 00:48:05,936
Admit it!
Did you rape her?

495
00:48:05,938 --> 00:48:08,397
Ow! Fuck! No!

496
00:48:08,399 --> 00:48:11,817
Admit it, you fucking faggot!
Did you fucking rape her?

497
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:15,281
I didn't fucking rape her!

498
00:48:38,554 --> 00:48:40,514
It hits quick.

499
00:48:46,812 --> 00:48:49,023
You like the way that feels?

500
00:48:51,067 --> 00:48:54,862
- Yeah.
- You want a couple of patches, girl?

501
00:48:55,988 --> 00:48:58,783
Okay.

502
00:49:04,872 --> 00:49:07,166
It's gonna cost you 300.

503
00:49:08,918 --> 00:49:14,338
- Come on. Pay up, little sis.
- I only have two dollars.

504
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,759
I said 300.

505
00:49:19,011 --> 00:49:21,806
Where are my pants?

506
00:49:23,683 --> 00:49:27,351
I'll just...
I'll just give it back.

507
00:49:27,353 --> 00:49:32,314
- I got a strict no-return policy.
- Yo, Mouse. Let me pay for it, man.

508
00:49:32,316 --> 00:49:35,401
I thought you was too good
for Fentanyl.

509
00:49:35,403 --> 00:49:38,779
What is it? Everybody's changing
their motherfucking minds on me?

510
00:49:38,781 --> 00:49:40,950
Yeah.

511
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:46,662
If she can't afford it, she gonna have
to find another way of paying me.

512
00:49:46,664 --> 00:49:48,497
- Straight up.
- Okay.

513
00:49:48,499 --> 00:49:51,002
Yo, man, just let me pay for it.

514
00:49:55,089 --> 00:49:57,133
I got the money right here.

515
00:49:59,844 --> 00:50:01,635
Here.

516
00:50:01,637 --> 00:50:03,804
Dang. Big brother
must love you.

517
00:50:03,806 --> 00:50:06,181
It's gonna cost you 600 now, man.

518
00:50:06,183 --> 00:50:08,892
Damn. You gonna do me
like that, bruh?

519
00:50:08,894 --> 00:50:11,186
Yeah, I'm gonna do you
like that. Straight up.

520
00:50:11,188 --> 00:50:14,650
Get that shit.
There it is.

521
00:50:20,698 --> 00:50:23,951
It's always a pleasure
doing business with you.

522
00:50:31,167 --> 00:50:33,459
Go flush that shit down the toilet,

523
00:50:33,461 --> 00:50:36,672
and go grab the Narcan,
just in case.

524
00:50:57,735 --> 00:50:59,945
I'm so happy.

525
00:51:04,867 --> 00:51:07,036
I know.

526
00:52:57,772 --> 00:53:00,189
<i>Yo, what's up? It's Fez.</i>

527
00:53:00,191 --> 00:53:03,235
Yeah, look. I'm gonna need
a little help with Rue.

528
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,031
Yeah. ASAP.

529
00:54:51,635 --> 00:54:53,971
Holy shit...

530
00:55:37,932 --> 00:55:42,059
- That guy you fucked in the pool?
- What?

531
00:55:42,061 --> 00:55:44,647
Are you sure you don't remember?

532
00:55:46,023 --> 00:55:48,107
I don't believe you.

533
00:55:48,109 --> 00:55:51,485
- Was it good?
- What?

534
00:55:51,487 --> 00:55:55,364
- The sex.
- What do you want to know, Nate?

535
00:55:55,366 --> 00:55:58,575
You want to know
if his dick was bigger?

536
00:55:58,577 --> 00:56:01,497
- Was it?
- What if it was?

537
00:56:02,665 --> 00:56:04,206
I'd fucking kill him.

538
00:56:04,208 --> 00:56:07,128
Yeah, but dead or alive, he'd still
have a bigger dick than you.

539
00:56:36,574 --> 00:56:38,617
I got you a present.

540
00:56:39,744 --> 00:56:41,704
Thank you.

541
00:59:14,538 --> 00:59:19,538
