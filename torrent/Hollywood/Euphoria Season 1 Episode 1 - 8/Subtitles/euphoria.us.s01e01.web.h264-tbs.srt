00:00:08,087 --> 00:00:10,254
<i>I was once happy. Content.</i>

3
00:00:10,256 --> 00:00:13,466
<i>Sloshing around in my own private,
primordial pool.</i>

4
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:15,926
<i>Then one day,
for reasons beyond my control,</i>

5
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:18,637
<i>I was repeatedly crushed...</i>

6
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:23,809
<i>over and over by the cruel
cervix of my mother, Leslie.</i>

7
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:27,188
<i>I put up a good fight, but I lost,</i>

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,735
<i>for the first time, but not the last.</i>

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,198
<i>I was born three days after 9/11.</i>

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,453
<i>I can hear you, I can hear you,
the rest of the world hears you,</i>

11
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:45,289
<i>and the people who knocked
these buildings down</i>

12
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,876
<i>will hear all of us soon.</i>

13
00:00:49,128 --> 00:00:52,757
<i>USA, USA! USA, USA!</i>

14
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:57,968
<i>My mother and father spent two days
in the hospital,</i>

15
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,888
<i>holding me under the soft glow
of the television,</i>

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,724
<i>watching those towers fall
over and over again,</i>

17
00:01:03,726 --> 00:01:07,019
<i>until the feelings of grief
gave way to numbness.</i>

18
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:09,021
<i>And then, without warning,</i>

19
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:11,398
<i>a middle-class childhood
in an American suburb.</i>

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,693
Thirteen... fourteen...

21
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:17,571
fifteen... sixteen...

22
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:19,365
- What are you looking at, Rue?
- Seventeen...

23
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:22,076
Rue, look at me.

24
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:28,292
- One, two, three...
- What are you doing, Rue?

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,049
I'd say she's suffering
from obsessive compulsive disorder...

26
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:38,717
<i>It's not like I was physically abused...</i>

27
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,302
...attention deficit disorder...

28
00:01:40,304 --> 00:01:41,971
- <i>...or had a shortage of clean water...</i>
- ...general anxiety disorder...

29
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:43,556
<i>...or was molested by a family member.</i>

30
00:01:43,558 --> 00:01:47,560
<i>...and possibly bipolar disorder.
But she's a little young to tell.</i>

31
00:01:47,562 --> 00:01:50,104
<i>So, explain this shit to me.</i>

32
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:52,106
Honey, it's just the way
your brain was hardwired.

33
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:56,652
Plenty of great, intelligent, funny,
interesting, and creative people

34
00:01:56,654 --> 00:01:59,363
have struggled with the same things
you struggle with.

35
00:01:59,365 --> 00:02:01,742
Like who?

36
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:04,287
Vincent Van Gogh.

37
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:08,998
<i>Sylvia Plath.</i>

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,500
And your favorite, Britney Spears.

39
00:02:11,502 --> 00:02:13,669
- <i>She's bald!</i>
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>

40
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:15,798
<i>She is completely bald.</i>

41
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:21,760
<i>I don't remember much
between the ages of eight and 12.</i>

42
00:02:21,762 --> 00:02:26,015
<i>Just that the world moved fast
and my brain moved slow.</i>

43
00:02:26,017 --> 00:02:29,187
Does anybody have any idea
of what a preposition might be?

44
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:35,234
<i>And every now and then, if I focused
too closely on the way I breathed...</i>

45
00:02:38,154 --> 00:02:40,573
<i>...I'd die.</i>

46
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,161
Slow down, just breathe.

47
00:02:47,163 --> 00:02:49,288
<i>Until every second of every day,</i>

48
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,085
<i>you find yourself
trying to outrun your anxiety.</i>

49
00:02:57,423 --> 00:02:59,340
What's wrong, Rue?

50
00:02:59,342 --> 00:03:01,258
<i>And quite frankly...</i>

51
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,053
I'm just fucking exhausted.

52
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:07,681
You said the doctor was in our network.
How could he suddenly be out of network?

53
00:03:07,683 --> 00:03:10,559
I can't afford it.

54
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:12,102
Did you see that video
of the beauty queen

55
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:14,230
who got acid thrown on her face?

56
00:03:14,232 --> 00:03:17,399
- Mm, what? No.
- It's pretty fucked up.

57
00:03:17,401 --> 00:03:21,197
- Hey, Mom, you got any tampons?
- In my bathroom, under the sink.

58
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:26,202
<i>And at some point, you make a choice
about who you are and what you want.</i>

59
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:33,668
Oh, my...

60
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:49,640
All right, Gia, let's roll.

61
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:52,476
Why is the co-payment $300?

62
00:03:52,478 --> 00:03:55,106
Rue, did you eat breakfast?

63
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:02,363
- What's with the sunglasses?
- What sunglasses?

64
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:17,877
I just showed up one day,
without a map or a compass...

65
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,670
<i>Attention, students,
we need to lockdown.</i>

66
00:04:19,672 --> 00:04:24,260
<i>...or to be honest, anyone capable of
giving on iota of good fucking advice.</i>

67
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:32,183
<i>And I know it all may seem sad,
but guess what?</i>

68
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:36,522
<i>I didn't build this system,
nor did I fuck it up.</i>

69
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:06,052
<i>And then it happens. That moment
when your breath starts to slow.</i>

70
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:17,522
<i>And every time you breathe, you
breathe out all the oxygen you have.</i>

71
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:23,067
<i>And everything stops:</i>

72
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:26,278
<i>your heart, your lungs,</i>

73
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,324
<i>then finally, your brain.</i>

74
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:36,582
<i>And everything you feel, and wish,
and want to forget, it all just sinks.</i>

75
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:43,214
<i>And then suddenly...</i>

76
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:52,306
<i>...you give it air again,
give it life again.</i>

77
00:05:57,103 --> 00:06:01,647
<i>I remember the first time it happened to
me I got so scared I wanted to call 911.</i>

78
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:05,611
<i>Go to the hospital and be kept alive
by machines and apple juice.</i>

79
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:10,573
<i>But I didn't want to look like an idiot,</i>

80
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:13,161
<i>and I didn't want
to fuck up everyone's night.</i>

81
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:19,206
<i>And then over time, it's all I wanted...</i>

82
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,961
<i>those two seconds of nothingness.</i>

83
00:07:11,677 --> 00:07:17,348
I spent a good portion of the summer
before junior year in rehab.

84
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:23,062
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

85
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:26,106
the courage to change the things I can,

86
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:28,402
and the wisdom to know the difference.

87
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:45,292
Rue!

88
00:07:45,294 --> 00:07:47,878
- Come here!
- Hey.

89
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,506
- How are you?
- Good.

90
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:52,383
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

91
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:54,637
Look at you. Are you growing? No.

92
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:58,683
Hey!

93
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,901
I'm very happy for you, Rue.

94
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:13,906
You're about to start
a brand-new chapter.

95
00:08:36,804 --> 00:08:40,975
<i>It was the end of summer,
the week before school started.</i>

96
00:08:43,603 --> 00:08:48,441
<i>I had no intention of staying clean.
And Jules had just moved to town.</i>

97
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:02,661
There's some new girl in town that
I think you gonna be friends with.

98
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:06,040
- Who?
- Shit, I don't know.

99
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:09,293
She came in yesterday
lookin' all Sailor Moon and shit.

100
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:14,381
I'm thinking to myself, like, look like
somebody Rue would get along with.

101
00:09:14,383 --> 00:09:17,259
<i>Which was sort of like
a dead-on observation for Fezco,</i>

102
00:09:17,261 --> 00:09:21,015
<i>who's not normally revolving
in the same direction as planet Earth.</i>

103
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:25,100
So, how long you been back?

104
00:09:25,102 --> 00:09:27,978
- Five days.
- And like, how are you feeling?

105
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,690
I mean, ever since I gave my life over
to my lord and savior Jesus Christ,

106
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:33,275
things have been, like, really good.

107
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:36,654
- Word? That's what's up.
- Yeah.

108
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:39,990
- I'm fucking with you. It was a joke.
- Shit.

109
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:42,868
Hey, I don't judge.

110
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,996
- But low-key, is Ashtray in the back?
- Are you serious?

111
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:48,666
What, you think 'cause I went
to rehab, I stayed clean?

112
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:51,418
I mean, ain't that the point?

113
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,462
Yeah, well,
the world's coming to an end,

114
00:09:53,464 --> 00:09:56,926
and I haven't even
graduated high school yet.

115
00:10:06,144 --> 00:10:08,060
I thought your ass was dead.

116
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:10,479
I thought you had Asperger's till
I realized you're just a prick.

117
00:10:10,481 --> 00:10:13,023
This is a fickle industry.
Y'all come and go.

118
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:16,360
I'm just trying to stack my cash,
pay off our mortgage.

119
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:18,614
So what the fuck you want?

120
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,119
- You don't want to try nothin' new?
- Like what?

121
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:30,249
2C-T-2, 2C-T-7,
and 5-MeO-DIPT.

122
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:32,460
I'm sorry, I have zero fucking idea
what you just said.

123
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:36,797
It doesn't matter.
But this shit is fucking lit.

124
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,135
- What is it?
- N-diisopropyl-5-methoxytryptamine.

125
00:10:41,137 --> 00:10:43,181
It's a fast-acting psychedelic.

126
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:49,810
<i>Got some similarities to LSD,
but with, like, key differences.</i>

127
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:54,901
<i>Not as visual and shit,
but definitely a sense distorter.</i>

128
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,490
What's wrong?

129
00:11:02,492 --> 00:11:05,242
I'm just so happy.

130
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:07,453
I don't know.
The shit's been blowing up in Tampa,

131
00:11:07,455 --> 00:11:10,289
and mad people like to fuck on it.

132
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:14,585
- Okay. Yeah.
- That'll be 120.

133
00:11:14,587 --> 00:11:16,962
- Fez said he'd spot me.
- Fezco don't spot nobody.

134
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:18,881
Yeah, well, it's a post-rehab discount,
so you should ask him.

135
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:20,676
I will go ask him,
'cause I know you're full of shit.

136
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:35,481
<i>In truth, I didn't have much of an issue
with Nate</i>

137
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:37,483
<i>until all the bullshit with Jules.</i>

138
00:11:37,485 --> 00:11:41,153
<i>I mean, I never liked him,
and once, during freshman formal,</i>

139
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:43,533
<i>he tried to finger me on the dance floor
without my permission.</i>

140
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:47,827
<i>But like... it's America.</i>

141
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:50,246
<i>And if they were throwing
an end-of-summer party...</i>

142
00:11:50,248 --> 00:11:53,582
Yo, I'd do it for Rue!

143
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:55,126
<i>...of course I'd fucking go.</i>

144
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:58,129
Yo. The whole world's
gonna be talking about

145
00:11:58,131 --> 00:12:01,257
how McKay threw the grimiest
fucking banger of the summer.

146
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:06,178
I don't know, bro. You know my mom is
real OCD. A little scratch on the wall,

147
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,721
the dishes are out of order.

148
00:12:07,723 --> 00:12:11,016
We'll just take a picture of everything.
We'll put it back the way we found it.

149
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:13,060
What the fuck is this,
Mission Impossible?

150
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:15,146
Would you stop worrying
about your mom,

151
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:16,939
and start worrying
about all the fucking pussy

152
00:12:16,941 --> 00:12:18,816
that we're gonna smash tonight, bro.

153
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:22,444
No, no, no, no, no. Wait.
Isn't Maddy coming tonight?

154
00:12:22,446 --> 00:12:26,365
I don't know. I don't give a fuck.
She broke up with me. Fuck her.

155
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:28,325
See, no, bro. 'Cause she's crazy.

156
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:31,579
I don't want her to come
and try to burn my house down.

157
00:12:31,581 --> 00:12:33,122
- Burn your...
- Yeah.

158
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:35,207
Shut the fuck up.

159
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:38,377
Yo. This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

160
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:40,671
Right here.
I'm gonna tell you something...

161
00:12:40,673 --> 00:12:43,674
- Don't do anything stupid. Come on.
- Yeah, yeah.

162
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:45,426
Hey, yo, what up, B?

163
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:48,220
Yo, how 'bout you come
and ride on this dick?

164
00:12:48,222 --> 00:12:50,683
No, Nate, chill, bro. Come on man.

165
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,727
Fuck, bro.

166
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:56,355
Whoops.

167
00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:09,535
<i>Jules moved from the city to the suburbs
after her mom and dad got divorced.</i>

168
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:14,413
<i>She doesn't really like
to talk about it,</i>

169
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:16,540
<i>but dads almost never get
full custody,</i>

170
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:19,378
<i>so you know some shit
definitely went down.</i>

171
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:24,590
<i>She went to, like, three weeks
of summer school with Kat,</i>

172
00:13:24,592 --> 00:13:27,720
<i>who failed Intro to Visual Arts.</i>

173
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:36,078
- Do you think my areolas look weird?
- No.

174
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,166
- But, like, the edges, though.
- Maddy, they're fine.

175
00:14:40,168 --> 00:14:41,959
Fine like they're kind of weird,
or fine like

176
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:44,044
nobody but me would ever notice
what I notice?

177
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:47,089
Fine like shut the fuck up, Maddy.

178
00:14:47,091 --> 00:14:49,133
I'm disgusting.
I literally look disgusting.

179
00:14:49,135 --> 00:14:51,760
Maddy, you just snap the fuck out
of this. You're hot as fuck.

180
00:14:51,762 --> 00:14:54,847
- Nate's a loser. Who cares?
- He's not a loser. He's a dick.

181
00:14:54,849 --> 00:14:57,183
All dicks are losers. Duh.

182
00:14:57,185 --> 00:14:59,852
Look, bottom line:
y'all need to walk into this party

183
00:14:59,854 --> 00:15:01,937
like your pussy costs a million dollars.

184
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:04,356
For real, I'd settle
for like fifty grand.

185
00:15:04,358 --> 00:15:05,983
Fifty grand is a million dollars.

186
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:09,695
I'd settle for, like, four Corona Lights
and some non-rapey affection.

187
00:15:09,697 --> 00:15:13,491
- That's kind of depressing.
- Nate's totally ruined my confidence.

188
00:15:13,493 --> 00:15:15,534
You know when somebody
just constantly criticizes,

189
00:15:15,536 --> 00:15:17,161
like, everything about you?

190
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:18,829
Yep. That's, like, every guy.

191
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:21,040
You just need to catch a dick
and forget about your troubles.

192
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:23,334
Girl, you just need to catch a dick.

193
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:25,044
Seriously, Maddy, the best thing
to do after a breakup

194
00:15:25,046 --> 00:15:27,004
is to fuck someone new,
and then move on.

195
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:29,882
Please, Kat, remind me again
how many guys you've fucked?

196
00:15:29,884 --> 00:15:33,260
And, oh, yeah, cat-fishing, that
don't count.

197
00:15:33,262 --> 00:15:36,639
Can you not be a cunt
for like, 15 seconds?

198
00:15:36,641 --> 00:15:41,145
Dad, stop being a pervert!
We're literally, like, all naked!

199
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:52,323
Fuck.

200
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:55,409
Okay.

201
00:15:58,287 --> 00:16:00,287
- Where were you?
- I went to eat.

202
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:02,623
- What do you mean, you went to eat?
- What?

203
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,209
What? Don't walk away from me.

204
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:08,671
- You know what, Rue? I don't trust you.
- I don't know what you want me to say.

205
00:16:08,673 --> 00:16:10,673
I want you to tell me where you were.

206
00:16:10,675 --> 00:16:13,092
- I just said I went to fucking eat!
- Don't you talk to me like that!

207
00:16:13,094 --> 00:16:14,677
You know what?
I'm gonna drug test you.

208
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,929
- Don't be slamming no doors around here.
- It was an accident.

209
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:19,723
I don't care. You're not leaving this
house until you take a drug test.

210
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:23,855
- I just peed!
- Slam another door.

211
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:27,733
That girl's gonna be the death of me.

212
00:16:34,031 --> 00:16:35,656
Shit.

213
00:16:35,658 --> 00:16:38,284
<i>Now, there's a few ways
to beat a drug test.</i>

214
00:16:38,286 --> 00:16:40,828
<i>The first is simple. Stop doing drugs.</i>

215
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:46,125
<i>But if you're in a bind and totally
fucked, option one: niacin.</i>

216
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:50,671
<i>It's a B vitamin that, like, breaks
down fat and chemicals or whatever,</i>

217
00:16:50,673 --> 00:16:53,466
<i>and if you take a lot of it,
like 2,000 milligrams,</i>

218
00:16:53,468 --> 00:16:55,428
<i>then chug a few gallons of water,</i>

219
00:16:55,636 --> 00:16:57,511
<i>you can flush your system
in two to three days.</i>

220
00:16:57,513 --> 00:16:59,972
<i>The only problem is,
it has a few side effects.</i>

221
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:02,099
<i>Skin flushing,
extreme dizziness, vomiting,</i>

222
00:17:02,101 --> 00:17:05,478
<i>rapid heartbeat,
and sometimes death.</i>

223
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,939
<i>I don't recommend it. Nor does
any legit drug site on the internet.</i>

224
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:12,195
<i>Option 2: synthetic urine.</i>

225
00:17:13,654 --> 00:17:15,279
<i>Yeah, fucking right.</i>

226
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:19,327
<i>Option 3: get a non-drug
addict friend to piss for you.</i>

227
00:17:21,537 --> 00:17:23,954
<i>The only problem is...</i>

228
00:17:23,956 --> 00:17:26,332
<i>...most over-the-counter
home drug testing kits</i>

229
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:30,085
<i>come with a heat-sensor strip that
detects the temperature of your urine.</i>

230
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:33,341
<i>And if your parents watch you pee,
you can't really do the sink trick.</i>

231
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:38,221
<i>So you gotta get it fresh.</i>

232
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,681
Hey, Rue.

233
00:17:42,683 --> 00:17:45,643
- Hey, I... I need a favor.
- What?

234
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:49,941
- I... like for real, Lexi.
- What?

235
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:54,360
<i>Side effects of this option?</i>

236
00:17:54,362 --> 00:17:56,403
Are you serious?

237
00:17:56,405 --> 00:17:58,032
Please.

238
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:01,994
Thanks.

239
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:07,498
Hey, Rue.

240
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,208
How was rehab?

241
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,212
Shit.

242
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:17,633
- It was good. It was really good.
- Well, that's good.

243
00:18:17,635 --> 00:18:20,302
- How long have you been back?
- Five days.

244
00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:22,056
Oh.

245
00:18:23,474 --> 00:18:25,683
- New chapter.
- Mom.

246
00:18:25,685 --> 00:18:27,893
Hmm?

247
00:18:27,895 --> 00:18:31,564
<i>Lexi and I have known each other
since pre-school.</i>

248
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:34,233
<i>And like, in some ways
she's my best friend,</i>

249
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:36,443
<i>even though I think we've grown apart.</i>

250
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:38,573
<i>We don't really have
much in common anymore.</i>

251
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:44,285
Did you meet any cute guys there?

252
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:47,748
- Here's that eyeliner.
- Thanks.

253
00:18:56,841 --> 00:18:58,843
Mom, I have to pee!

254
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:01,844
I wish we could do this in a way

255
00:19:01,846 --> 00:19:04,847
that wasn't a complete
invasion of my privacy.

256
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:07,391
Well, you lost your right to
privacy after your overdose.

257
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:10,062
- That was a mistake.
- Don't be flip, Rue.

258
00:19:11,814 --> 00:19:15,151
Could you... Thank you.

259
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,574
You don't understand.
This was the most frightening moment

260
00:19:23,576 --> 00:19:25,826
a mother could witness. And Gia...

261
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:30,080
- Gia, who absolutely idolizes you...
- I know, Mom.

262
00:19:30,082 --> 00:19:32,919
To have her find you unconscious...

263
00:19:35,922 --> 00:19:38,923
Can we just...
Can we not do this right now, Mom?

264
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:40,635
Rue?

265
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:45,181
Rue?

266
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:50,436
Rue.

267
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:03,825
<i>I know a lot of you probably hate me
right now, and I get it.</i>

268
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:09,122
<i>If I could be a different person,
I promise you, I would.</i>

269
00:20:10,873 --> 00:20:15,084
<i>Not because I want it,
but because they do.</i>

270
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:17,630
<i>And therein lies the catch.</i>

271
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:24,595
I'm sorry...
for slamming the door earlier.

272
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:32,603
It's okay. I forgive you. Come here.

273
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:42,027
Hey, Mom?

274
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:44,071
- Yeah?
- Can I spend the night at Lexi's?

275
00:20:44,073 --> 00:20:46,031
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Thanks.

276
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:47,702
Yeah.

277
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:50,139
- Where you going?
- I don't know. Some party, or something.

278
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,557
Or something?

279
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,895
Dad.

280
00:21:57,271 --> 00:22:00,648
I know. You know, just, new town.
Be safe.

281
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,651
- Yeah. I'm fine.
- Good.

282
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:05,611
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

283
00:22:05,613 --> 00:22:07,698
- Okay.
- Have fun.

284
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,969
<i>Jules told me later what had happened.</i>

285
00:23:02,753 --> 00:23:04,670
<i>Looking back on it,</i>

286
00:23:04,672 --> 00:23:08,299
<i>she probably would have just
been better off going to McKay's.</i>

287
00:23:08,301 --> 00:23:09,719
<i>But...</i>

288
00:23:39,707 --> 00:23:41,584
Come in.

289
00:23:50,551 --> 00:23:53,385
Yo, so, Cassie's a whore. Fact.

290
00:23:53,387 --> 00:23:56,722
No, she's not. Fact.
She's not even that type of girl.

291
00:23:56,724 --> 00:23:59,475
Oh. Have you seen
her slut pages, though?

292
00:23:59,477 --> 00:24:01,560
- No.
- They're wild, yo.

293
00:24:01,562 --> 00:24:04,313
- She's like a fuckin' freak
- Cassie's on the slut pages?

294
00:24:04,315 --> 00:24:06,607
Yo, we gotta see this shit.

295
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:08,275
Yo, what are y'all even doing
out the room, man?

296
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:09,860
- Go back upstairs, bro.
- What?

297
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:12,071
- Thing one and thing two. Take it up.
- Oh, yo.

298
00:24:12,073 --> 00:24:14,990
- Take it up.
- Relax. No one gets here till ten.

299
00:24:14,992 --> 00:24:18,410
What's up, Nate? What's good,
what's good, good lookin'.

300
00:24:18,412 --> 00:24:21,747
Look, all I'm saying is,
I think you did Cassie. That's it.

301
00:24:21,749 --> 00:24:24,667
Whether I like her
or not is irrelevant.

302
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:28,337
The fact is, she's a fucking whore
through and through, bro.

303
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:30,923
All right, look, I don't know what
she's done, guys, but I'm just saying,

304
00:24:30,925 --> 00:24:34,218
I think she's cool. She's smart.
She's funny.

305
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,763
Bro, she likes cars, man.

306
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,516
She loves cars.
Shit, thank you for telling me.

307
00:24:40,518 --> 00:24:42,560
- What the fuck?
- Dude's got mad feelings.

308
00:24:42,562 --> 00:24:45,020
For real, yo. McKay's
about to start a Pinterest, guys.

309
00:24:45,022 --> 00:24:47,314
Just wait. Give it a minute.

310
00:24:47,316 --> 00:24:50,319
Yo, did you say you don't know
what she's done?

311
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,784
No, I don't know.

312
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:02,331
Take a seat. You and I are gonna take
a little trip to the land of shame, bro.

313
00:25:09,964 --> 00:25:12,339
<i>Here's the fucking thing that
pisses me off about the world.</i>

314
00:25:12,341 --> 00:25:15,050
<i>Like, every time
someone's shit gets leaked,</i>

315
00:25:15,052 --> 00:25:17,011
<i>whether it's J. Law or Leslie Jones,</i>

316
00:25:17,013 --> 00:25:19,096
<i>the whole world's like, "Well
if you don't want it out there,</i>

317
00:25:19,098 --> 00:25:20,723
<i>don't take the nudes
in the first place."</i>

318
00:25:20,725 --> 00:25:25,644
<i>I'm sorry. I know your generation relied
on flowers and fathers' permission,</i>

319
00:25:25,646 --> 00:25:28,481
<i>but it's 2019,
and unless you're Amish,</i>

320
00:25:28,483 --> 00:25:32,067
<i>nudes are the currency of love,
so stop shaming us.</i>

321
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:35,446
<i>Shame the assholes who create
password-protected online directories</i>

322
00:25:35,448 --> 00:25:38,532
<i>of naked, underage girls.</i>

323
00:25:38,534 --> 00:25:41,076
<i>Cassie's actually super sweet.</i>

324
00:25:41,078 --> 00:25:43,496
<i>You remember, like, from earlier.</i>

325
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:47,833
- Yo, Rue, Rue.
- Hey. How you been?

326
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:49,960
She's just being coy.

327
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:53,798
'Cause she has a new boyfriend
she's head over heels for.

328
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,467
Mom, stop being retarded.
He's not my boyfriend.

329
00:25:56,469 --> 00:25:58,469
Oh. Okay.

330
00:25:58,471 --> 00:26:01,722
Who's that handsome young man
who came over for dinner last night?

331
00:26:01,724 --> 00:26:05,851
- Oh, my God, Mom! Stop!
- Christopher McKay.

332
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:07,812
So, you're dating McKay.

333
00:26:07,814 --> 00:26:11,273
Okay, Mom, I'm literally going
to poison you in your sleep.

334
00:26:11,275 --> 00:26:13,319
So, Rue, how was rehab?

335
00:26:17,657 --> 00:26:19,990
Did you meet any cute guys there?

336
00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:23,244
- Here's that eyeliner.
- Thanks.

337
00:26:23,246 --> 00:26:25,037
<i>But anyway, back to this bullshit.</i>

338
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,000
And the Oscar goes to...

339
00:26:29,293 --> 00:26:31,418
- Oh!
- Shit!

340
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,629
<i>I'm talkin' 'bout, like, tag team.</i>

341
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:36,465
- That's what I'm saying. Double team.
- Like, triple.

342
00:26:36,467 --> 00:26:39,593
- With Roy in the front.
- You can't tell that that's her, man.

343
00:26:39,595 --> 00:26:42,221
- It's her, bro.
- This is her. Look at her titties.

344
00:26:42,223 --> 00:26:45,516
You want my advice?
You fuck her like the whore she is,

345
00:26:45,518 --> 00:26:47,184
you kick her ass to the curb.

346
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:48,936
If you don't, we will.

347
00:26:48,938 --> 00:26:50,938
Shut your all little virgin asses
up, man.

348
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,606
Y'all wouldn't even know
what to do with that.

349
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:56,986
Are you crazy?
I just got a tutorial, step-by-step.

350
00:26:56,988 --> 00:26:59,029
<i>It's obvious
that Nate got in McKay's head,</i>

351
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:03,327
<i>because Cassie told Lexi, and Lexi
told me, that the night of the party...</i>

352
00:27:05,163 --> 00:27:07,081
What?

353
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:11,167
Nothing.

354
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:13,379
Why do you keep staring at me?

355
00:27:16,883 --> 00:27:21,302
I'm sorry.
Kind of spaced out for a second.

356
00:27:21,304 --> 00:27:23,598
I wasn't being weird, was I?

357
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:27,018
No. You're being cute.

358
00:27:28,394 --> 00:27:31,522
Listen, I don't want to sound corny
or whatever, but...

359
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,192
...you are literally the most
beautiful girl I've ever seen.

360
00:27:36,194 --> 00:27:38,446
<i>They hooked up.</i>

361
00:27:46,412 --> 00:27:49,163
Fuck.

362
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:51,081
You always this wet?

363
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,336
Kind of. It's super embarrassing.

364
00:27:54,587 --> 00:27:59,175
- Does it turn you off?
- Not at all. It's cool.

365
00:28:02,678 --> 00:28:05,181
Stay right here.

366
00:28:29,747 --> 00:28:31,124
Aah!

367
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,876
McKay. McKay, stop! Stop...

368
00:28:35,878 --> 00:28:38,045
<i>Now, I know this looks disturbing,
but for real,</i>

369
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:41,340
<i>I promise you,
this does not end in a rape.</i>

370
00:28:41,342 --> 00:28:45,761
<i>But here's the thing. Everyone
on the planet watches porn. Fact.</i>

371
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:50,015
<i>And if you were to click on the 20 most
popular videos on Porn Hub right now,</i>

372
00:28:50,017 --> 00:28:52,101
<i>this is basically what you'd see:</i>

373
00:28:52,103 --> 00:28:54,272
<i>Good girl, yes, yes.</i>

374
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:58,067
<i>Are you gonna be
an obedient little slut?</i>

375
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,237
- <i>Say thank you, again.</i>
- <i>Oh, thank you.</i>

376
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:05,531
I'm not trying to be sex negative
or anything. I'm just saying...

377
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:07,074
Stop!

378
00:29:07,076 --> 00:29:08,784
...this shit isn't
out of left fucking field.

379
00:29:08,786 --> 00:29:11,370
- Fuck, McKay!
- What did I do?

380
00:29:11,372 --> 00:29:12,913
Why would you grab me like that?
I couldn't breathe.

381
00:29:12,915 --> 00:29:17,001
- I don't know. I thought you liked that.
- Why the fuck would I like that?

382
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:19,920
Cassie, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

383
00:29:19,922 --> 00:29:22,758
I just didn't expect it.

384
00:29:29,765 --> 00:29:33,058
Cassie, I'm really sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

385
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:37,563
You know I would never do anything
to hurt you.

386
00:29:37,565 --> 00:29:39,400
Just don't do it again.

387
00:29:43,488 --> 00:29:45,781
Unless you ask me first.

388
00:29:52,371 --> 00:29:54,540
Or I ask you.

389
00:30:00,421 --> 00:30:03,172
<i>Anyway, I didn't go to Lexi's.
That was a lie.</i>

390
00:30:03,174 --> 00:30:05,257
<i>So, I was walking to McKay's party,</i>

391
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:07,929
<i>because I have this rule that
I don't drink and bike, 'cause like...</i>

392
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:20,189
- Is that...?
- Oh, shit. Slow down.

393
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:22,149
Dude, that's Rue. Oh, my God.

394
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:24,360
- Wait. Didn't Rue, like, die?
- Oh, my God, I hate ghosts.

395
00:30:24,362 --> 00:30:27,740
Yo, Casper! You want a ride?

396
00:30:31,994 --> 00:30:33,788
Why, thank you.

397
00:31:13,035 --> 00:31:17,623
- Ah. How old are you?
- 22.

398
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:21,544
Thanks.

399
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:24,920
Do you live in town?

400
00:31:24,922 --> 00:31:27,673
No. I'm just, visiting my grandparents.

401
00:31:27,675 --> 00:31:29,469
Hmm.

402
00:31:30,928 --> 00:31:32,805
What about you?

403
00:31:33,931 --> 00:31:36,142
Do you walk around like this?

404
00:31:38,352 --> 00:31:40,686
What do you mean?

405
00:31:40,688 --> 00:31:44,106
Well, this is how you look generally?

406
00:31:44,108 --> 00:31:46,986
I mean... yeah.

407
00:31:50,448 --> 00:31:52,533
You're beautiful.

408
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,662
Thank you.

409
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:03,836
I'm envious of your generation,
you know.

410
00:32:05,713 --> 00:32:09,757
You guys don't care
as much about the rules.

411
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:13,052
You know, I think that's a good thing.

412
00:32:13,054 --> 00:32:16,722
And I don't want to be that old
guy that gives you advice,

413
00:32:16,724 --> 00:32:20,184
but I look at you
and I think there are...

414
00:32:20,186 --> 00:32:23,687
two versions
of how your life can go.

415
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:26,482
You can either go someplace,

416
00:32:26,484 --> 00:32:30,402
where you're wanted for who you are.

417
00:32:30,404 --> 00:32:35,449
Or you can stay in a town like this.
End up like me.

418
00:32:35,451 --> 00:32:38,162
Living your life out in motel rooms.

419
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,293
Selfishly...

420
00:32:45,878 --> 00:32:49,173
I hope you stay.

421
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:52,969
Wider.

422
00:32:54,345 --> 00:32:56,764
Wider. There you go.

423
00:32:57,807 --> 00:33:00,935
That's it. Good girl.

424
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:12,903
<i>Jules once told me that
every night when she was a kid,</i>

425
00:33:12,905 --> 00:33:15,197
<i>like, five or something...</i>

426
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:17,491
Spit.

427
00:33:17,493 --> 00:33:19,410
<i>...she'd lock herself
in the bathroom,</i>

428
00:33:19,412 --> 00:33:21,620
<i>get down on her
hands and knees, and...</i>

429
00:33:21,622 --> 00:33:22,999
<i>pray to God.</i>

430
00:33:28,671 --> 00:33:33,340
<i>She'd pray that when she woke up
in the morning, she'd be 25 years old.</i>

431
00:33:33,342 --> 00:33:36,594
<i>She'd live with her best friend, a girl.</i>

432
00:33:36,596 --> 00:33:39,305
<i>Someone she hadn't met yet, but...</i>

433
00:33:39,307 --> 00:33:41,976
<i>someone she knew
she'd trust forever.</i>

434
00:33:48,941 --> 00:33:51,233
<i>I don't know why,
but when she told me that story,</i>

435
00:33:51,235 --> 00:33:54,862
<i>I started to cry so hard
I hyperventilated.</i>

436
00:33:54,864 --> 00:33:59,410
You're so clean.
And you don't know how rare that is.

437
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,541
<i>Jules just kept laughing
and saying, "What's wrong?" But...</i>

438
00:34:07,543 --> 00:34:09,504
I didn't know.

439
00:34:44,122 --> 00:34:46,290
<i>And then, the night got weird.</i>

440
00:35:26,873 --> 00:35:28,833
- Hey.
- Hey.

441
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:13,751
<i>Now, there's a couple versions
of what happened that night.</i>

442
00:36:13,753 --> 00:36:16,045
<i>It all depends on who you ask,
and to be honest,</i>

443
00:36:16,047 --> 00:36:19,300
<i>I'm not always
the most reliable narrator.</i>

444
00:36:22,637 --> 00:36:25,471
<i>But Nate was fucking on one.</i>

445
00:36:25,473 --> 00:36:29,143
<i>And in turn,
Maddy was fucking on one.</i>

446
00:36:34,607 --> 00:36:36,651
Hi.

447
00:36:43,616 --> 00:36:45,368
Get undressed.
I want to go swimming.

448
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:06,681
- You're so hot.
- I know.

449
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,411
You're fucking crazy.

450
00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:34,874
No, I'm not. I'm just trying to get back
at my really shitty ex-boyfriend.

451
00:37:34,876 --> 00:37:36,584
What?

452
00:37:36,586 --> 00:37:41,881
What if I told you that I wanted you
to fuck me, right here, right now?

453
00:37:41,883 --> 00:37:44,592
Are you serious?

454
00:37:44,594 --> 00:37:47,595
<i>And that's right about the time that
Jules decided to ghost her hookup</i>

455
00:37:47,597 --> 00:37:51,182
<i>and bike over to McKay's.</i>

456
00:37:51,184 --> 00:37:54,687
<i>Now, Jules texted Kat,
but Kat didn't answer, because...</i>

457
00:38:06,616 --> 00:38:09,366
So what's the deal
with your friend, BB?

458
00:38:09,368 --> 00:38:13,287
- What about her?
- Is she a prude, or is she a slut?

459
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:15,372
Definitely a slut.

460
00:38:15,374 --> 00:38:18,709
- What about you?
- What about me?

461
00:38:18,711 --> 00:38:23,005
- Are you a slut?
- Yeah, I'm a fucking savage.

462
00:38:23,007 --> 00:38:28,385
- Oh, yeah? What's your number?
- Higher than you two can count.

463
00:38:28,387 --> 00:38:31,889
Stop playing. You're a fucking prude.

464
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:34,850
<i>Now, Kat wasn't a prude,
but she was a virgin.</i>

465
00:38:34,852 --> 00:38:38,437
<i>She'd told Jules that a week into summer
school, and when Kat saw her reaction:</i>

466
00:38:38,439 --> 00:38:41,317
Bitch, this isn't the '80s.
You need to catch a dick.

467
00:38:45,112 --> 00:38:48,906
She was on a mission to enter junior
year as a woman of questionable morals.

468
00:38:48,908 --> 00:38:50,783
Let me ask you a question.

469
00:38:50,785 --> 00:38:54,163
If I were to pull my dick out
right now, would you suck it?

470
00:38:55,957 --> 00:38:58,876
- I don't know. Let me see it.
- It's not hard yet.

471
00:39:00,461 --> 00:39:02,711
You've probably never
sucked a dick in your life.

472
00:39:02,713 --> 00:39:05,881
- Yeah, I have.
- Most girls don't know how to suck dick.

473
00:39:05,883 --> 00:39:08,384
- Yeah.
- What do you mean?

474
00:39:08,386 --> 00:39:11,178
Well, they're too gentle.
It's like, they're fucking scared of it.

475
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,097
- Not in porn.
- Exactly.

476
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:15,850
- You watch porn?
- Doesn't everyone?

477
00:39:15,852 --> 00:39:18,269
No. Every guy does. Yeah.

478
00:39:18,271 --> 00:39:21,105
Not prudes. Only sluts.

479
00:39:21,107 --> 00:39:25,442
- Yeah, well...
- Yeah, but like, how much?

480
00:39:25,444 --> 00:39:28,072
- What?
- How much of a slut are you?

481
00:39:29,991 --> 00:39:33,826
Mm. Why don't you come find out?

482
00:39:33,828 --> 00:39:36,539
Why don't you take your top off?

483
00:39:37,582 --> 00:39:41,250
Like, right now, in front of...
in front of these two?

484
00:39:41,252 --> 00:39:43,335
Yeah.

485
00:39:43,337 --> 00:39:45,423
I dare you.

486
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:09,071
Yo, you know what they say, right?
Fat girls give the best head.

487
00:40:22,752 --> 00:40:26,253
I was out back talking to Fezco
when Jules arrived.

488
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:28,088
What the fuck, Rue?

489
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,674
What? What, what, what, what?

490
00:40:30,676 --> 00:40:34,220
Come on now, bruh.
You owe me 120 bucks.

491
00:40:34,222 --> 00:40:39,393
- My bad, man, I forgot.
- Shit, you know I ain't trippin'.

492
00:40:41,437 --> 00:40:43,312
Well, to be honest with you,

493
00:40:43,314 --> 00:40:46,607
your whole drug shit
got me feeling kind of uneasy.

494
00:40:46,609 --> 00:40:49,276
Come on, don't go soft on me, Fez.

495
00:40:49,278 --> 00:40:52,404
No, I'm not. It's just that...

496
00:40:52,406 --> 00:40:55,866
I like you.
And I missed you, bruh. Like...

497
00:40:55,868 --> 00:41:00,287
That shit at the beginning of summer
had me scared as fuck.

498
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:03,374
- Yeah, you and everybody else.
- I'm serious, Rue.

499
00:41:03,376 --> 00:41:06,129
I've seen a lot of people die.

500
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:10,047
None like you.

501
00:41:10,049 --> 00:41:14,677
I don't know what type of fucked up shit
you got going inside your head.

502
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:18,681
I don't know how to help,
but I could tell you one thing:

503
00:41:18,683 --> 00:41:21,269
this drug shit, it's not the answer.

504
00:41:27,024 --> 00:41:30,278
You know, I remember
when I was eleven years old...

505
00:41:31,529 --> 00:41:34,363
It was a couple months
after my dad got diagnosed,

506
00:41:34,365 --> 00:41:37,283
and we got the results back
from the prognosis.

507
00:41:37,285 --> 00:41:40,828
And it was really good.
It was like, 80/20.

508
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:43,747
And we decided to celebrate, so...

509
00:41:43,749 --> 00:41:46,544
we like ordered a bunch of Chinese food.

510
00:41:48,129 --> 00:41:52,381
I remember that night,
I was laying between my parents in bed,

511
00:41:52,383 --> 00:41:54,051
and...

512
00:41:55,845 --> 00:41:58,556
all of a sudden I couldn't breathe.

513
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:05,394
It was like
there was no more air left in the world.

514
00:42:05,396 --> 00:42:09,690
And I was gasping, and I was panicking.

515
00:42:09,692 --> 00:42:13,068
And they called the ambulance
and they thought it was like...

516
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:16,530
an allergic reaction or some shit.

517
00:42:16,532 --> 00:42:20,034
And then when I got to the hospital,

518
00:42:20,036 --> 00:42:22,330
they gave me liquid Valium.

519
00:42:24,165 --> 00:42:27,460
Yeah. To calm me down.

520
00:42:30,129 --> 00:42:32,381
And when it hit me, I thought...

521
00:42:34,717 --> 00:42:37,676
This is it.

522
00:42:37,678 --> 00:42:41,889
This is the feeling I have been
searching for my entire life,

523
00:42:41,891 --> 00:42:44,558
for as long as I could remember.

524
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,604
Because suddenly...

525
00:42:47,647 --> 00:42:50,439
...the world went quiet.

526
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:54,612
And I felt safe, in my own head.

527
00:42:59,408 --> 00:43:01,994
Two years later, he was gone.

528
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:06,582
Panic attacks stayed.

529
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:11,710
And I found a way to live, so...

530
00:43:11,712 --> 00:43:14,171
Will it eventually kill me? Maybe.

531
00:43:14,173 --> 00:43:17,176
Fuck, maybe not. I don't know.

532
00:43:21,556 --> 00:43:24,306
You still gonna be my dealer, Fez?

533
00:43:24,308 --> 00:43:27,852
You a fucking trip, bruh.

534
00:43:27,854 --> 00:43:31,397
I'm too high to be having
this conversation right now.

535
00:43:31,399 --> 00:43:33,774
Yeah, man. Me, too.

536
00:43:33,776 --> 00:43:36,487
Me fucking too.

537
00:44:22,283 --> 00:44:25,159
Yeah, that's real classy,
you fucking whore.

538
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:27,745
Suck my dick.

539
00:44:27,747 --> 00:44:29,248
Ooh!

540
00:44:42,512 --> 00:44:45,971
Get the fuck out of here!
Get the fuck out of the kitchen! Fuck!

541
00:44:45,973 --> 00:44:49,811
Get out of here!
Get the fuck out of here!

542
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,150
What the fuck are you looking at?

543
00:44:59,821 --> 00:45:01,403
Who are you?

544
00:45:01,405 --> 00:45:04,698
- I'm Jules. I'm a friend of...
- You're a friend of...

545
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,034
A friend of whose?
'Cause you're not my fucking friend.

546
00:45:07,036 --> 00:45:11,038
Who the fuck are you friends with,
Jules? Hmm?

547
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,291
Do you guys know
who the fuck this is?

548
00:45:14,293 --> 00:45:16,627
Does anybody know who this is?

549
00:45:16,629 --> 00:45:19,964
Does anybody know
who the fuck Jules is?

550
00:45:19,966 --> 00:45:23,886
Anyone at all. You,
do you know who the fuck Jules is?

551
00:45:26,597 --> 00:45:29,098
So, who are you?

552
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,518
I'm just minding my own business.
I'm not trying to start anything.

553
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,812
Well, no, you're not.
Nobody that looks like you

554
00:45:34,814 --> 00:45:37,316
is minding their own fuckin' business.

555
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:42,153
I know what you are.

556
00:45:42,155 --> 00:45:45,030
Yeah. Yeah, I see you.

557
00:45:45,032 --> 00:45:47,783
So what do you want?

558
00:45:47,785 --> 00:45:50,536
You want some, some fucking attention?

559
00:45:50,538 --> 00:45:53,416
'Cause I'll give you
some fucking attention.

560
00:45:55,501 --> 00:46:00,087
Yo, is anybody here friends
with Jules?

561
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:02,840
Anyone? Does anybody know
who the fuck this bitch is?

562
00:46:02,842 --> 00:46:07,470
Somebody better speak up,
or this bitch is gonna get fucked up

563
00:46:07,472 --> 00:46:09,054
Shit!

564
00:46:09,056 --> 00:46:11,557
- You wanna fucking hurt me?
- No, I was fucking kidding!

565
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:14,393
Back the fuck up!
What the fuck is your problem?

566
00:46:14,395 --> 00:46:15,978
Put the fucking knife down, okay.

567
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,022
- It was a joke.
- You wanna fucking hurt me?

568
00:46:18,024 --> 00:46:21,901
- No, no, no...
- You have no fucking idea

569
00:46:21,903 --> 00:46:23,986
- See?
- You're psycho!

570
00:46:23,988 --> 00:46:26,155
- I'm fucking invincible!
- You're a fucking freak.

571
00:46:26,157 --> 00:46:28,534
What the fuck?

572
00:46:34,582 --> 00:46:37,333
By the way, I'm Jules.

573
00:46:37,335 --> 00:46:39,460
I just moved here.

574
00:46:39,462 --> 00:46:42,590
<i>I mean... right?</i>

575
00:46:52,642 --> 00:46:55,518
Where the fuck have you been?
You missed the craziest shit ever.

576
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,311
I just lost my virginity.

577
00:46:57,313 --> 00:47:00,397
Bitch, are you fucking serious?
With who?

578
00:47:00,399 --> 00:47:02,107
This guy from St. Mary's.

579
00:47:02,109 --> 00:47:05,194
- How did you like it?
- It was nice. Yeah.

580
00:47:05,196 --> 00:47:08,825
Oh, my God.
My little slut. I'm so proud of you

581
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:18,082
Yo! Shit...

582
00:47:18,084 --> 00:47:21,043
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. It's fine.

583
00:47:21,045 --> 00:47:22,670
Guess I knew
that was gonna get violent,

584
00:47:22,672 --> 00:47:25,047
and I didn't want a fucking
broken cheekbone or some shit.

585
00:47:25,049 --> 00:47:27,508
Yeah, no,
I totally I get the logic behind it.

586
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:30,388
But it's still, like, fucking insane.

587
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:40,062
- I'm Rue.
- I'm Jules.

588
00:47:40,064 --> 00:47:42,606
Where are you headed to?

589
00:47:42,608 --> 00:47:45,111
Home. Probably.

590
00:47:46,696 --> 00:47:48,823
Can I come with you?

591
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:43,085
Shh.

592
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,850
Let me see.

593
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:01,354
Oh.

594
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,951
- Shh
- Sorry. Sorry.

595
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,684
<i>Remember when I said
things got weird?</i>

596
00:51:07,021 --> 00:51:10,483
<i>So... yeah.</i>

597
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:42,932
I've got an idea.

598
00:51:44,308 --> 00:51:46,642
What?

599
00:51:46,644 --> 00:51:48,813
Wanna get high?

600
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:53,950
