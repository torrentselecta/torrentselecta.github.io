00:01:08,913 --> 00:01:13,582
<i>One of the benefits of showing up
at a hospital with a kidney infection</i>

3
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:15,543
<i>is the first thing they do...</i>

4
00:01:15,545 --> 00:01:17,086
Take this with water.

5
00:01:17,088 --> 00:01:18,837
<i>...is give you something
to bring down your fever</i>

6
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:21,215
<i>and subdue
the agonizing pain you're in.</i>

7
00:01:21,217 --> 00:01:23,594
- Is this a Vicodin?
- Yes.

8
00:01:26,305 --> 00:01:29,682
- Five milligrams?
- Yes.

9
00:01:29,684 --> 00:01:31,852
<i>I know what you're all thinking.</i>

10
00:01:33,646 --> 00:01:36,063
I had my wisdom teeth out
a few years ago

11
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:39,650
and they gave me Vicodin
and it's not good for me.

12
00:01:39,652 --> 00:01:42,154
It really upsets my stomach.

13
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:44,989
Okay.

14
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:48,450
I'd rather take Tylenol instead.

15
00:01:48,452 --> 00:01:51,787
Are you sure? Kidney infections
are extremely painful.

16
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,749
I'm sure.

17
00:01:55,167 --> 00:02:00,880
Unless... I forget
what they put me on instead...

18
00:02:00,882 --> 00:02:07,636
It sounded like a candy name...
Like Rox... something?

19
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:10,556
- Roxicet?
- Yes. That's it.

20
00:02:10,558 --> 00:02:17,354
- Roxicet. 7,5 milligrams.
- Let me check with the doctor.

21
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:19,523
Thanks.

22
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:23,027
<i>It's not a relapse if it's warranted.
It's a hall pass.</i>

23
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:24,987
God please don't get in the way!

24
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:26,697
According to the paperwork
your mother filled out,

25
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:29,783
it appears you have some pretty
extreme substance abuse issues,

26
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:34,207
so I think you're right,
we should just stick with Tylenol.

27
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:43,255
OK. If I come back someday with cancer,
I really hope you're not my doctor.

28
00:02:43,257 --> 00:02:45,176
Yeah, I'm serious!

29
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,805
Can I still get the Vicodin?

30
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:56,602
<i>They put me on Cipro. They give it
to people that are exposed to anthrax,</i>

31
00:02:56,604 --> 00:02:58,145
<i>started me on Lexipro,</i>

32
00:02:58,147 --> 00:03:02,233
<i>which is one of the few antidepressants
that doesn't make me crazier,</i>

33
00:03:02,235 --> 00:03:05,653
<i>and kept me there for three days.</i>

34
00:03:05,655 --> 00:03:10,074
<i>It was actually really nice.
I love hospitals.</i>

35
00:03:10,076 --> 00:03:13,869
<i>If I could spend the rest of my life
in a hospital I would.</i>

36
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:18,749
<i>Because when you're in a hospital,
you have zero responsibilities.</i>

37
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:21,794
<i>They make sure you eat.
Sleep. Stay hydrated.</i>

38
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:24,338
<i>And if anything bad happens,
there's always a doctor nearby.</i>

39
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,881
Thank you!

40
00:03:25,883 --> 00:03:29,802
<i>It's also the best place to be
in the event of a mass shooting,</i>

41
00:03:29,804 --> 00:03:32,139
<i>unless a gunman kills all the surgeons.</i>

42
00:03:33,307 --> 00:03:36,435
<i>Point is, I had zero anxiety.</i>

43
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:49,613
<i>At nighttime, when everyone's asleep,
if I close my eyes</i>

44
00:03:49,615 --> 00:03:52,741
<i>and imagine all the little beeps
to be the sounds of birds,</i>

45
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:56,495
<i>and the lukewarm air blowing through
the vent to be a warm breeze,</i>

46
00:03:56,497 --> 00:04:00,082
<i>your hospital bed
can sort of feel like a poolside chair</i>

47
00:04:00,084 --> 00:04:03,921
<i>on a hot summer night
in the Caribbean.</i>

48
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,217
<i>Plus Jules came to visit.</i>

49
00:04:11,345 --> 00:04:15,474
- Did all this happen because I left?
- No.

50
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:20,021
You promise?

51
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:24,690
Yeah.

52
00:04:24,692 --> 00:04:27,570
I've kinda been this way my whole life.

53
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:31,616
Not all the time, but sometimes.

54
00:04:34,035 --> 00:04:36,287
But you do make it better.

55
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,922
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,634
For what?

57
00:04:52,637 --> 00:04:55,012
For not telling you the truth.

58
00:04:55,014 --> 00:05:00,809
<i>For everyone who was calling me manic,
I was like 92 percent correct.</i>

59
00:05:00,811 --> 00:05:03,606
<i>But something
was different about Jules.</i>

60
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:07,568
Rue, you look fucking amazing.

61
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,696
Jules, I'm deeply uncomfortable
right now.

62
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:18,702
You look hot and the fact that
you usually dress like Seth Rogen

63
00:05:18,704 --> 00:05:23,415
although you make it cute sometimes
it crushes my soul.

64
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:26,043
I don't dress like Seth Rogen.

65
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:28,587
When was the last time you didn't wear
a hoodie or sweatpants?

66
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:32,800
- I don't know. Now?
- Exactly.

67
00:05:32,802 --> 00:05:35,302
Which is why are we gonna finish.

68
00:05:35,304 --> 00:05:40,391
It was the most amazing weekend ever.

69
00:05:40,393 --> 00:05:42,770
I can't stop thinking about it.

70
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:50,693
It was like the first time
I've ever felt like I had a family.

71
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:54,864
That wasn't my Dad, or like you kind of.

72
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:56,532
My God!

73
00:05:56,534 --> 00:06:02,162
- Rue, you would die for Anna.
- Who's Anna?

74
00:06:02,164 --> 00:06:07,293
She's just like next level.
I don't know...

75
00:06:07,295 --> 00:06:11,171
And you hooked up or something?

76
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:15,634
Yeah. It was kinda crazy.
We went to the club...

77
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:21,098
And the energy was like crazy.
And I was feeling it.

78
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:26,562
And she just like grabbed me
and sort of like pushed me down.

79
00:06:26,564 --> 00:06:29,106
And like kissed me.

80
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:33,360
- And she fucking bit me.
- What do you mean she bit you?

81
00:06:33,362 --> 00:06:36,574
When we were hooking up,
she fully bit me.

82
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:40,119
Look!

83
00:06:43,915 --> 00:06:47,958
- Did it like feel good?
- Yeah, it felt amazing.

84
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,254
Does anyone ever done that to you?

85
00:06:51,631 --> 00:06:54,089
- No.
- You wanna see what it feels like?

86
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:55,843
I don't know.

87
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,388
What?

88
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,935
- You don't like it?
- I don't think so.

89
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:11,106
- Did you like it?
- I liked it.

90
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:13,567
You gotta meet this kids.

91
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:19,031
'Cause I swear you would
fucking flourish in that energy.

92
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:20,910
I've never felt anything like it.

93
00:07:23,496 --> 00:07:25,373
There!

94
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,501
I missed you so much!

95
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:40,304
You look beautiful.

96
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:43,849
Thanks. You, too.

97
00:07:45,476 --> 00:07:50,356
- By the way, fuck Nate Jacobs!
- Fuck Nate Jacobs!

98
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:54,900
I know you're not supposed
to say things like this out loud,

99
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:56,696
but if I ever got the chance
I'd fuck him.

100
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:06,247
What a fucking pussy!

101
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:37,361
- Hi, I'm Leslie, Rue's Mom.
- Hi Leslie!

102
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:42,573
They asked me to write a letter

103
00:08:42,575 --> 00:08:46,493
about what your addiction
has cost us as a family.

104
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:50,458
And as I sat down last night
to write it...

105
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:56,962
...I couldn't stop thinking
about the day you were born.

106
00:08:56,964 --> 00:09:00,507
Holding you in my arms
for the first time.

107
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:05,389
Looking down at you.
Your sweet beautiful face.

108
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:11,354
I had never felt so much love
and joy in my entire life.

109
00:09:12,438 --> 00:09:16,607
And I thought that
what if in that moment,

110
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:21,320
I heard a voice,
some omniscient narrator who said:

111
00:09:21,322 --> 00:09:24,615
"Here's what's going to happen..."

112
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:30,329
<i>Your daughter is going to be funny,
and smart and outgoing.</i>

113
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:32,373
<i>You'll see it from a young age.</i>

114
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:36,544
- Are you guys drinking wine?
- I mean, barely.

115
00:09:36,546 --> 00:09:40,091
We're waiting for you to leave
so we can get to the hard stuff.

116
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:46,639
Relax. I'm not triggered or anything.

117
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:51,767
- I'm joking.
- Let's take some pictures. Come on!

118
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:56,939
<i>She'll be charismatic
and make friends easily.</i>

119
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:59,026
<i>She'll be kind and sensitive...</i>

120
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:03,197
<i>Maybe too sensitive.</i>

121
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,868
<i>She won't be an easy child.</i>

122
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:09,996
<i>She'll struggle.</i>

123
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:17,835
Just walk in
and hold your head up high, baby.

124
00:10:17,837 --> 00:10:22,381
<i>And in turn,
you'll struggle to understand her.</i>

125
00:10:22,383 --> 00:10:26,554
- You look beautiful!
- I don't know...

126
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:31,640
<i>To understand
what's going on inside her head.</i>

127
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:35,021
<i>The night terrors
that can't be interrupted.</i>

128
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:42,776
<i>The times after dinner
when she'll sit at the kitchen table</i>

129
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:47,575
<i>and count the tiles over and over
until she hyperventilates.</i>

130
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:54,205
- Do you have a date?
- No.

131
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:58,417
<i>The fight to hold her in your arms.
To tell her it's okay.</i>

132
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:01,172
It makes me look stupid?

133
00:11:02,757 --> 00:11:05,259
No. Not in the least.

134
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:11,889
<i>To calm down
the kicking, the screaming.</i>

135
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:14,769
<i>The anxiety of being harmed.</i>

136
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:20,481
<i>The transitions from day to night.
From home to school.</i>

137
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:22,318
<i>From meal to meal.</i>

138
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:27,865
<i>Of losing her mother
or father or little sister.</i>

139
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:32,952
- You have a beautiful house.
- Thank you!

140
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:34,580
- Hi!
- Hi!

141
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:37,831
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

142
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,416
That's an understatement.

143
00:11:39,418 --> 00:11:41,043
<i>...of being alone.</i>

144
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:42,628
I already like her.

145
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:47,216
<i>The panic attacks. Mood swings.
Confusion. Disorganization.</i>

146
00:11:47,218 --> 00:11:49,595
- Have fun!
- I will!

147
00:11:56,936 --> 00:11:58,521
My God!

148
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:05,860
<i>And all that rage,
not just at you but at herself.</i>

149
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:07,989
<i>And the tough part is...</i>

150
00:12:11,284 --> 00:12:14,827
<i>...you'll feel as helpless to help her
as she does herself.</i>

151
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:17,121
- What is it?
- Gatorade and Everclear.

152
00:12:17,123 --> 00:12:20,459
<i>You'll make mistakes.
Small ones. And big ones.</i>

153
00:12:25,006 --> 00:12:28,132
<i>You'll look for help
from people who aren't helpful.</i>

154
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:31,137
<i>Or who don't understand
what's happening.</i>

155
00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:41,856
<i>And the guilt will never leave you.</i>

156
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:48,613
Love you, Grandma!

157
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:58,370
<i>But if you remain calm and patient,
if you listen closely,</i>

158
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:00,206
<i>you'll understand her more.</i>

159
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:04,376
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm having an asthma thing.

160
00:13:04,378 --> 00:13:09,342
<i>The counting, the repetition,
the need for symmetry.</i>

161
00:13:10,635 --> 00:13:13,219
<i>That if you kiss her left cheek
before bed,</i>

162
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:18,059
<i>you have to kiss her right cheek.
and her forehead, then her chin.</i>

163
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:23,270
<i>That it's about balance. Stability.</i>

164
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:28,776
<i>The need to organize her feelings
and thoughts so she can breathe easier.</i>

165
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:33,074
- I feel really good tonight.
- Really? Why?

166
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,284
I was thinking this is the first time
since the beginning of high school

167
00:13:37,286 --> 00:13:39,828
that I haven't been in love
with someone.

168
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,791
I love that for you.

169
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:47,922
I've always really been
into pick-up trucks.

170
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:53,594
Can you take your shoes off the dash?

171
00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:05,479
<i>And there will be moments of relief.
In her and in you.</i>

172
00:14:05,481 --> 00:14:09,441
<i>Moments that feel so normal
and calm and rewarding</i>

173
00:14:09,443 --> 00:14:13,781
<i>that you'll find yourself
praying they last forever.</i>

174
00:14:15,408 --> 00:14:18,784
<i>Even though she's only a child.</i>

175
00:14:18,786 --> 00:14:21,956
<i>And all the hardest parts
have yet to even come.</i>

176
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:17,176
What if these are
the big moments in life?

177
00:15:17,178 --> 00:15:21,555
My mom talks about high school like
it was this monumental part of her life.

178
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:25,643
But I cannot imagine being 40 and
looking back on this moment like: wow.

179
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:28,145
That's because most people
peak in high school.

180
00:15:28,147 --> 00:15:32,316
- I definitely haven't peaked.
- I'm not even a person yet.

181
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:35,319
I'm definitely like 25% peakness.

182
00:15:35,321 --> 00:15:41,325
I'm at a hundred percent.
But I can definitely get to one fifty.

183
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:44,747
- I never thought I'd make it this far.
- What do you mean?

184
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:50,042
I've always had this anxiety
that something bad would happen.

185
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:54,004
Last summer, there were 3 weeks
where I actually thought you were dead.

186
00:15:54,006 --> 00:15:57,299
She's been sober for 3 months.

187
00:15:57,301 --> 00:16:00,221
Weren't you in rehab
like six months ago?

188
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:06,976
Maybe people get nostalgic
about high school

189
00:16:06,978 --> 00:16:11,564
because it's like the last time
in your life you get to dream.

190
00:16:11,566 --> 00:16:16,404
After is like, bad jobs,
and bills, and bad husbands...

191
00:16:20,032 --> 00:16:24,954
Maybe I'm generalizing.
But you know what I mean?

192
00:16:26,205 --> 00:16:28,581
I kinda feel the opposite.

193
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:32,042
I feel like high school's
super suffocating.

194
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:35,423
- Really?
- Yeah!

195
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:42,722
I'll be right back.

196
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:30,517
First of all, ew! Second of all, ew!

197
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:33,481
- Just a second.
- Are you not hard?

198
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:37,441
No, I am. Fuck!

199
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:40,152
It doesn't really feel
like you're hard.

200
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:44,573
- I am. I'm... I am hard.
- This isn't something you lie about.

201
00:17:44,575 --> 00:17:46,450
Maddy, I just got
a lot of shit on my mind.

202
00:17:46,452 --> 00:17:49,453
- Like during sex?
- Stop!

203
00:17:49,455 --> 00:17:52,706
- Stop what?
- Talking. Stop talking. Fuck!

204
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,959
I'm officialy turned off! Get off me.

205
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:57,962
- Why are we even having sex?
- We weren't.

206
00:17:57,964 --> 00:18:02,132
You know what your problem is?
You can't keep your mouth shut.

207
00:18:02,134 --> 00:18:05,261
- And you can't keep your dick hard.
- Maybe I can't keep my dick hard

208
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:08,138
because everyone at school
is spreading rumors about me.

209
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,307
They're not rumors. They're facts.

210
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:13,435
You had forty different guys' dicks
in your phone.

211
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:17,231
- I told you not to tell anyone.
- I told people before you told me.

212
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:21,235
- You told them out of context.
- What is the context?

213
00:18:21,237 --> 00:18:24,071
I'd tell you
but I don't even trust you anymore.

214
00:18:24,073 --> 00:18:27,324
Kinda like how you'd fuck me
but you're not hard anymore?

215
00:18:27,326 --> 00:18:31,163
Keep talking! Keep fucking talking!

216
00:18:39,964 --> 00:18:44,341
- I don't mind if you're into guys.
- I'm not into fucking guys, Maddy.

217
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:47,720
- Sexuality is a spectrum.
- What are you talking about?

218
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:51,348
It's not like anyone's 100% straight
or 100% gay.

219
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,477
That is 100% bullshit.

220
00:19:41,234 --> 00:19:44,860
I don't know you. You might be
a good girl. You might not.

221
00:19:44,862 --> 00:19:49,114
- But I do know my son.
- Do you?

222
00:19:49,116 --> 00:19:52,326
I'm not defending him.
But I do wanna protect him.

223
00:19:52,328 --> 00:19:55,373
And what I know is this relationship
you two have is not sustainable.

224
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:00,876
And it's only a matter of time
before it takes the both of you down.

225
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:04,966
Sometimes the two people who aren't
meant for each other find each other.

226
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:12,515
You're a beautiful girl.
And a smart one. It's time to let go.

227
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,520
Your whole family is so fucking weird.

228
00:20:49,135 --> 00:20:53,637
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen, this is
the game you've all been waiting for.</i>

229
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:57,766
<i>This is the first game back for
the Hawks starting QB Nate Jacobs.</i>

230
00:20:57,768 --> 00:21:00,769
<i>It could be the final game
of his high-school career</i>

231
00:21:00,771 --> 00:21:04,648
<i>unless he can bring home the W and
get this struggling team to regionals.</i>

232
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,526
<i>Speaking of struggles,
he's had a lot off the field.</i>

233
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:12,114
<i>It's been a topic of conversation
around the team and in this community.</i>

234
00:21:12,116 --> 00:21:14,366
<i>Can he overcome those struggles?</i>

235
00:21:14,368 --> 00:21:16,744
<i>I think Nate Jacobs
is gonna unify this ball club.</i>

236
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:19,830
<i>Thankfully,
his teammates have his back.</i>

237
00:21:19,832 --> 00:21:23,626
<i>How much of the game
is he going to put on his back?</i>

238
00:21:23,628 --> 00:21:25,628
Here we go. It's game time!

239
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,175
Red twelve. Hut!

240
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:50,530
Maddy, don't!

241
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,372
- Maddy, don't do it!
- Fuck this!

242
00:22:06,837 --> 00:22:08,422
Can you dance?

243
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,471
- Can you dance?
- Fuck yeah.

244
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,492
I guarantee you Maddy and Nate
are gonna get married.

245
00:22:38,494 --> 00:22:44,081
Probably divorce three times and in some
strange way live a pretty happy life.

246
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,667
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

247
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:48,421
Yeah.

248
00:23:15,156 --> 00:23:16,991
Jules?

249
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:24,165
Jules?

250
00:23:25,499 --> 00:23:27,750
- What're you doing?
- Nothing.

251
00:23:27,752 --> 00:23:30,171
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

252
00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:34,340
I like the way I dressed you,

253
00:23:34,342 --> 00:23:37,803
but I'm worried I fucked
with your gender expression.

254
00:23:39,055 --> 00:23:41,013
Thank you.

255
00:23:41,015 --> 00:23:44,060
I feel a little stupid. So...

256
00:23:48,856 --> 00:23:52,318
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

257
00:23:53,903 --> 00:23:55,738
Why don't you kiss me?

258
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,492
I kiss you.

259
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:04,455
No, why don't you like,
kiss-kiss me?

260
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:10,962
I mean did you want me
to like, kiss-kiss you?

261
00:24:14,674 --> 00:24:20,721
I want you to wanna kiss me so bad
that you don't even ask.

262
00:24:29,397 --> 00:24:31,983
Okay. Fuck it. Let's dance.

263
00:25:14,191 --> 00:25:15,818
What?

264
00:25:20,448 --> 00:25:24,200
I feel like love is super dark
and like no one ever talks about it.

265
00:25:24,202 --> 00:25:28,120
Yeah, but that might be specific
to their kind of love.

266
00:25:28,122 --> 00:25:30,416
Or my kind of love.

267
00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:52,394
I'm gonna do everything in my power

268
00:25:52,396 --> 00:25:55,397
for at least the next three years
to not fall in love.

269
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:59,862
- What if you do?
- Intervene and fucking destroy it.

270
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:21,507
- Hey!
- Hey.

271
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:25,763
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

272
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,127
What's up?

273
00:26:57,753 --> 00:27:02,715
I don't really know what else to say
other than I'm so sorry.

274
00:27:02,717 --> 00:27:06,760
But that night at the carnival
when you were flirting with that girl,

275
00:27:06,762 --> 00:27:09,932
I had this reaction,
and I just like hated you.

276
00:27:11,434 --> 00:27:14,687
Whether that's fair or not I don't know.

277
00:27:16,856 --> 00:27:23,277
I guess I wanted to hurt you as much
as I'd imagined you'd hurt me.

278
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,946
I know that sounds juvenile.
But it's true.

279
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:28,324
And I wouldn't even be saying this
to you.

280
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:31,118
Because you're actually not like this.
You're actually really kind.

281
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,746
And you're actually really nice
and I just...

282
00:27:33,748 --> 00:27:37,958
I'm so shitty
and I wish I could go back.

283
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,462
Kat, I liked you
since I sat down next to you.

284
00:27:41,464 --> 00:27:45,927
You think there's like zero chance
that we're gonna be together forever.

285
00:27:47,136 --> 00:27:51,599
I don't know, I guess were both juniors
so you're probably right about that.

286
00:27:53,142 --> 00:27:55,937
I mean like is one of us
gonna get hurt?

287
00:27:57,605 --> 00:28:00,191
Yeah, probably.

288
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:05,530
But I'll do my best
to make sure that it's me.

289
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,287
- I'm crying. Sorry.
- It's okay.

290
00:28:29,262 --> 00:28:31,722
- Sorry, was that awkward?
- No.

291
00:28:40,231 --> 00:28:44,110
- Wanna get the fuck out of here?
- Yeah.

292
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:48,362
What did you say?

293
00:28:48,364 --> 00:28:51,574
I started to say one thing
and then I said something else.

294
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:54,036
But she knows what I meant.

295
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:39,457
- I'll be right back.
- Alright.

296
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:58,559
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

297
00:29:59,685 --> 00:30:02,980
How do you decide
who you wanna hook up with?

298
00:30:04,982 --> 00:30:09,443
- They usually just come to you.
- Yeah, but what if they don't?

299
00:30:09,445 --> 00:30:12,532
Then go and do
whoever the fuck you want.

300
00:30:13,741 --> 00:30:17,453
Yeah. Okay.

301
00:30:21,332 --> 00:30:23,209
I'm gonna do that.

302
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:29,840
- I love you, Lex.
- I love you, too.

303
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:49,986
Cassie?

304
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,408
- I'm okay.
- You sure?

305
00:30:56,534 --> 00:30:59,287
- Yeah.
- Okay.

306
00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:22,641
- Any history of depression?
- I guess, the normal amount.

307
00:31:22,643 --> 00:31:26,228
- But not diagnosed?
- No.

308
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,649
Family history with depression?

309
00:31:29,942 --> 00:31:32,276
Yeah. My mom.

310
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:36,780
- Any history with drugs or alcohol?
- No. Not really.

311
00:31:36,782 --> 00:31:41,245
Any family history with addiction,
alcohol, other substances?

312
00:31:44,081 --> 00:31:47,960
Yeah. My mom with wine.

313
00:31:50,129 --> 00:31:54,467
And then my dad with painkillers
and then heroin and stuff.

314
00:32:06,646 --> 00:32:09,398
How do you feel
about being here today?

315
00:32:13,277 --> 00:32:14,820
Nervous, I guess.

316
00:32:16,072 --> 00:32:20,618
Do you have any reservations about
the procedure? Any second thoughts?

317
00:32:25,915 --> 00:32:27,458
No.

318
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:30,169
Come with me.

319
00:32:35,925 --> 00:32:38,759
Welcome back! Fourth quarter.
Time running down.

320
00:32:38,761 --> 00:32:41,554
Hawks trailing 23 to 27...

321
00:32:41,556 --> 00:32:44,890
<i>Here we go it's first and ten
on the twenty.</i>

322
00:32:44,892 --> 00:32:48,686
<i>A minute and a half left to go
in what is a very close game.</i>

323
00:32:48,688 --> 00:32:51,814
Green 13. Hut!

324
00:32:51,816 --> 00:32:56,610
<i>Here we go. Jacob steps back.
He's looking. He sees...</i>

325
00:32:56,612 --> 00:32:59,031
He's got a guy! He throws it up.

326
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:05,995
<i>A perfect ball by Jacobs goes right
through the hands of the receiver.</i>

327
00:33:05,997 --> 00:33:08,749
<i>Jacobs threw up a perfect ball.</i>

328
00:33:12,753 --> 00:33:16,171
<i>My gosh. Again right
through the receiver's hands.</i>

329
00:33:16,173 --> 00:33:18,382
Let's fucking go!

330
00:33:18,384 --> 00:33:22,054
<i>The wide receivers have got
to give their QB some help tonight.</i>

331
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,323
Why do I feel like you're the reason
Fez's house got raided?

332
00:33:42,325 --> 00:33:49,580
Sometimes when you do illegal shit,
bad things happen to you.

333
00:33:49,582 --> 00:33:52,291
You ever done anything illegal?

334
00:33:52,293 --> 00:33:56,505
- You talking about your friend Jules?
- Actually I'm talking about your Dad.

335
00:34:01,093 --> 00:34:04,053
I just wanna make sure
you've given it some forethought.

336
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:06,805
I know over the years
you've lost some brain cells.

337
00:34:06,807 --> 00:34:09,308
I wouldn't want you
to say something you might regret.

338
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:14,563
You gonna ruin my life?
I can do that a lot better than you can.

339
00:34:14,565 --> 00:34:17,691
- What do you want, Rue?
- I want you to leave Fez alone.

340
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:22,615
And Jules. If you ever fuck with
them again, I'll destroy your life.

341
00:34:23,741 --> 00:34:26,742
I'll destroy your dad's life.
I'll burn your whole shit to the ground.

342
00:34:26,744 --> 00:34:29,995
Because I personally have no problem
walking into any police station

343
00:34:29,997 --> 00:34:35,503
and telling them that Nate Jacob's
daddy likes to fuck little kids.

344
00:34:39,131 --> 00:34:41,715
You look very pretty tonight.

345
00:34:41,717 --> 00:34:46,053
Are you sure
that Jules told you everything?

346
00:34:46,055 --> 00:34:49,890
You know what I like about her?
She has these very real dreams.

347
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:53,938
And I seriously think
that she's gonna achieve them.

348
00:34:56,065 --> 00:35:00,192
If you look at everyone inside,
most of them are gonna go on

349
00:35:00,194 --> 00:35:04,323
and live these lives that aren't
even fucking worth mentioning.

350
00:35:05,408 --> 00:35:07,825
Not Jules.

351
00:35:07,827 --> 00:35:09,952
What about you?

352
00:35:09,954 --> 00:35:15,418
- Honestly, I don't really give a fuck.
- I gathered that.

353
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:19,503
It's why you're spending all your time
with someone who's gonna leave you

354
00:35:19,505 --> 00:35:23,384
and won't even remember
who the fuck you are in ten years.

355
00:35:26,888 --> 00:35:31,350
I really meant what I said.
You look really beautiful.

356
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:40,484
Alright, here we go.
Ten seconds left on the clock.

357
00:35:42,278 --> 00:35:44,361
<i>Can Nate Jacobs do it?</i>

358
00:35:44,363 --> 00:35:48,490
<i>It could be the final play of the game,
could be the final play of his career.</i>

359
00:35:48,492 --> 00:35:50,328
Set!

360
00:35:51,412 --> 00:35:56,373
Blue 36. Hut!

361
00:35:56,375 --> 00:36:00,127
<i>And there's the snap. Nate Jacobs.
He steps back. He's looking.</i>

362
00:36:00,129 --> 00:36:03,839
<i>He's off! He's running.
He's taking the game into his hands.</i>

363
00:36:03,841 --> 00:36:06,967
<i>There he goes. He breaks a tackle.
He's at the thirty.</i>

364
00:36:06,969 --> 00:36:10,471
<i>He's at the 20. He's gonna do it!
He's at the ten. He's at the five!</i>

365
00:36:10,473 --> 00:36:11,891
<i>He's in!</i>

366
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:22,443
Let's go! Let's fucking go!
Let's go! Get the fuck up!

367
00:36:24,111 --> 00:36:27,112
<i>And the East Highland crowd
going bananas.</i>

368
00:36:27,114 --> 00:36:30,910
<i>He has warmed this place up.
This kid can get it done!</i>

369
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:45,130
You may have won the game.
But you lost control of the team.

370
00:36:45,132 --> 00:36:48,469
And in the long run if you don't lead,
you're gonna lose.

371
00:37:09,156 --> 00:37:14,120
You need to take a step back, Nate.
I said take a step back.

372
00:37:17,707 --> 00:37:20,374
Get the fuck off me!

373
00:37:20,376 --> 00:37:23,377
Get your fucking hands off me you
fucking faggot! Get the fuck off!

374
00:37:23,379 --> 00:37:25,421
- Stop fighting!
- Get the fuck off!

375
00:37:25,423 --> 00:37:30,092
- Stop fighting!
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

376
00:37:30,094 --> 00:37:33,014
- You had enough?
- Get the fuck off me!

377
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:38,561
- Keep it up!
- Get off!

378
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,443
Do you wanna keep fighting?
You think you're tough now?

379
00:37:46,694 --> 00:37:48,529
Come on Nate!

380
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:54,947
- What?
- I fucking hate this town.

381
00:39:56,407 --> 00:39:59,450
If I could I'd burn it
to fucking the ground.

382
00:39:59,452 --> 00:40:01,829
And salt the earth behind you.

383
00:40:08,252 --> 00:40:10,504
Jules, are you in love with Anna?

384
00:40:15,843 --> 00:40:18,262
Yeah.

385
00:40:23,226 --> 00:40:24,977
Are you...

386
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:28,981
Are you in love with me?

387
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,196
Yeah.

388
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:39,158
Do you wish I was different?

389
00:40:44,705 --> 00:40:47,375
This will help with the discomfort.

390
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:56,175
Some patients like to listen to music.

391
00:41:06,435 --> 00:41:09,230
And just a little pinch.

392
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:13,211
CERTIFICATE OF RECOGNITION
DR. PHILLIP REDMOND, MD

393
00:42:39,904 --> 00:42:46,075
What if we just fucking left?
We just fucking left this dance.

394
00:42:46,077 --> 00:42:49,705
We went home, grab a bunch
of our shit and just went to the city?

395
00:42:50,873 --> 00:42:52,750
That's fucking crazy.

396
00:43:21,904 --> 00:43:27,199
I ain't here to hurt you. If you fuck
around, I swear to God I'll kill you.

397
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:30,913
- Where's the money at?
- It's in the table.

398
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:44,343
We're almost done.

399
00:44:10,953 --> 00:44:12,663
Move slow!

400
00:44:31,891 --> 00:44:38,105
Jesus fucking Christ!
You're a fucking doctor?

401
00:44:44,946 --> 00:44:47,281
Hurry the fuck up, man!

402
00:45:12,932 --> 00:45:16,267
What the fuck you doing?
Drop the fucking gun.

403
00:45:16,269 --> 00:45:21,148
Bitch ass motherfucker!
Motherfucker! You're fucking dead!

404
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:43,210
<i>Stop! Let go of my fucking gun!
Bitch ass motherfucker!</i>

405
00:45:43,212 --> 00:45:46,716
<i>I told you to fucking be calm!
Bitch! Why would you do that?</i>

406
00:45:48,926 --> 00:45:52,471
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Come on!

407
00:45:58,561 --> 00:46:00,185
But we didn't bike here.

408
00:46:00,187 --> 00:46:03,357
- Let's go!
- My god!

409
00:46:15,953 --> 00:46:17,663
Hold on!

410
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:22,710
What the fuck did you do that for?

411
00:46:23,836 --> 00:46:25,920
Fuck!

412
00:46:25,922 --> 00:46:30,509
Fuck! Shit! God damn!

413
00:47:50,756 --> 00:47:53,215
Jules...

414
00:47:53,217 --> 00:47:55,303
Is this a bad idea?

415
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:02,143
No.

416
00:48:12,278 --> 00:48:13,696
What the fuck?

417
00:48:15,364 --> 00:48:17,783
How do you feel?

418
00:48:21,954 --> 00:48:24,415
Better.

419
00:48:54,654 --> 00:48:57,613
- Maddy get up.
- No. Why?

420
00:48:57,615 --> 00:49:00,449
Could you stop being such a cunt
and just come dance with me please.

421
00:49:00,451 --> 00:49:04,078
- You don't even know how to dance.
- It's a slow song. Let's go. Get up.

422
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,791
Firstly, your despicable, but fine.

423
00:49:17,635 --> 00:49:20,930
- I really fucking hate you.
- I know.

424
00:49:22,265 --> 00:49:25,933
You're abusive. You're psychopathic.

425
00:49:25,935 --> 00:49:30,062
And most of the time I really hate
the way you make me feel.

426
00:49:30,064 --> 00:49:34,569
- I know.
- It's not good for us.

427
00:49:37,738 --> 00:49:40,281
I know.

428
00:49:40,283 --> 00:49:43,202
No, but like, we shouldn't be together.

429
00:49:49,959 --> 00:49:51,836
I know.

430
00:50:08,185 --> 00:50:09,604
Hi!

431
00:50:11,314 --> 00:50:13,065
Hi.

432
00:50:15,651 --> 00:50:21,530
I thought this was gonna be
a night I'd remember forever.

433
00:50:21,532 --> 00:50:27,411
I think you will remember it forever.
Like, not in a bad way.

434
00:50:27,413 --> 00:50:31,834
Just in a way that stays with you.

435
00:50:36,172 --> 00:50:37,840
Yeah.

436
00:50:46,474 --> 00:50:48,724
You're late.

437
00:50:48,726 --> 00:50:51,687
I got caught up
dealing with some bullshit.

438
00:50:53,648 --> 00:50:56,526
I heard you got raided.

439
00:50:59,862 --> 00:51:04,408
But they didn't find nothing though.
They ain't got shit on me.

440
00:51:06,827 --> 00:51:08,746
Let's hope not.

441
00:51:34,021 --> 00:51:36,232
So, we all good?

442
00:51:48,494 --> 00:51:51,829
<i>Here you go. Deck seven,
departing in two minutes.</i>

443
00:51:51,831 --> 00:51:53,875
Thank you.

444
00:52:07,555 --> 00:52:11,265
Jules, I just realized
that I didn't bring my medication.

445
00:52:11,267 --> 00:52:13,809
We can get medication like everywhere.

446
00:52:13,811 --> 00:52:18,147
Yeah, but I don't think it's...
I can like miss a day.

447
00:52:18,149 --> 00:52:21,944
Rue, we'll figure it out. I promise.

448
00:52:31,245 --> 00:52:34,079
Jules, I don't think
this is a good idea.

449
00:52:34,081 --> 00:52:36,624
- Rue, it was your idea.
- I know it was my idea.

450
00:52:36,626 --> 00:52:39,501
But I don't think
it's a good idea anymore.

451
00:52:39,503 --> 00:52:41,670
It was a fucking great idea.

452
00:52:41,672 --> 00:52:44,340
Can you just slow 'cause I'm thinking,
you know my mom,

453
00:52:44,342 --> 00:52:46,717
I don't want her to fucking freak out.

454
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:51,597
Rue, it's not that far and we're good.
We can call.

455
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:56,270
What am I gonna tell Gia though?
She's gonna think I'm missing.

456
00:52:58,147 --> 00:53:01,609
We're good. Come on!
It's gonna be amazing.

457
00:53:04,111 --> 00:53:05,947
Rue!

458
00:53:18,167 --> 00:53:20,044
Come on!

459
00:53:25,591 --> 00:53:29,637
Please! I love you!

460
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:51,991
<i>And there will be moments of relief.
In her and in you.</i>

461
00:53:51,993 --> 00:53:56,078
<i>Moments that feel so normal
and calm and rewarding</i>

462
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:59,709
<i>that you'll find yourself
praying they last forever.</i>

463
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:04,712
<i>Even though she's only a child.</i>

464
00:54:04,714 --> 00:54:08,050
<i>And all the hard parts
have yet to even come.</i>

465
00:54:09,635 --> 00:54:15,097
<i>And at the age of sixteen,
she'll overdose,</i>

466
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:19,645
<i>spend four days in a coma and you
won't know if she'll live or die.</i>

467
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:25,985
<i>But when she wakes up, she'll
be given the opportunity to get clean...</i>

468
00:54:27,236 --> 00:54:31,282
<i>...to become a different person.
A better person.</i>

469
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:35,242
<i>Here's the toughest part.</i>

470
00:54:35,244 --> 00:54:41,624
<i>No matter what you say or do or wish
the decision will be all hers</i>

471
00:54:41,626 --> 00:54:47,089
<i>and all you can do is hope she gives
herself the chance that she deserves.</i>

472
00:57:04,143 --> 00:57:06,185
Did you take my money out of the wallet?

473
00:57:06,187 --> 00:57:08,520
No, ma'am.

474
00:57:08,522 --> 00:57:10,606
- Rue?
- What?

475
00:57:10,608 --> 00:57:13,943
- I asked you a simple question.
- You make everything worse.

476
00:57:13,945 --> 00:57:16,489
It's fucking forty dollars.

477
00:57:18,866 --> 00:57:21,827
- What the fuck do you want?
- Get out of my face!

478
00:58:17,967 --> 00:58:21,802
- Mom, you're such a fucking bitch?
- I'm a bitch?

479
00:58:21,804 --> 00:58:24,263
Yeah, you're a fucking bitch
because you just fucking sat...

480
00:58:24,265 --> 00:58:26,015
Please stop. Stop!

481
00:58:26,017 --> 00:58:30,477
There's something wrong with her.
She's trying to get better.

482
00:58:30,479 --> 00:58:33,981
She's fucking mental. And I'm tired
of you using it as an excuse.

483
00:58:33,983 --> 00:58:37,486
- Do you think this helps?
- It doesn't matter. I'm done.

484
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:12,313
Leave! I don't care! Go!

485
00:59:16,442 --> 00:59:19,779
Fucking psychotic bitch.
You fucking make me wanna go.

486
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:22,865
Fucking crazy!

487
00:59:25,243 --> 00:59:31,121
- Are you proud?
- Go after your sister.

488
00:59:31,123 --> 00:59:35,461
- You wanna be like her. Okay?
- I don't wanna be like you.

489
01:03:56,390 --> 01:04:01,390
