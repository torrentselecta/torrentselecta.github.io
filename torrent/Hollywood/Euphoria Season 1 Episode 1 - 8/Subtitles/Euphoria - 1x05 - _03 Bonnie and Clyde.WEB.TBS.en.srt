1
00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:02,974
Rue is in love with Jules, I think.

2
00:00:04,366 --> 00:00:05,765
Hey, I'm Ethan.

3
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:06,902
I'm Kat.

4
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:13,628
You look different.

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,221
I changed.

6
00:00:17,543 --> 00:00:18,790
'Sup, Cass.

7
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,083
You wanna ride the carousel?

8
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:22,917
That's the guy from the motel.

9
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:26,646
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

10
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:29,215
- That's Nate's dad?!
- Yes. That's Nate's dad.

11
00:00:30,088 --> 00:00:31,693
Hey. Tyler?

12
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:34,303
God, are you broken inside.

13
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:37,978
I went through Nate's
phone, and it was weird.

14
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:41,035
I need you to promise me that
you're not gonna tell a soul.

15
00:00:43,012 --> 00:00:45,518
I'm sorry I got so angry at you before.

16
00:00:52,227 --> 00:00:54,990
Maddy knew who she was
from a very early age.

17
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:06,802
For as long as Maddy could
remember, everybody loved her.

18
00:01:06,803 --> 00:01:10,343
♪ You must be my lucky star ♪

19
00:01:10,344 --> 00:01:14,593
♪ 'Cause you shine on
me wherever you are ♪

20
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:17,093
She never knew exactly what it was.

21
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:19,885
She just knew that she
had something special,

22
00:01:19,886 --> 00:01:21,426
something intangible,

23
00:01:21,427 --> 00:01:23,510
something immeasurable.

24
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:27,426
♪ Star light, star bright,
first star I see tonight ♪

25
00:01:27,427 --> 00:01:29,338
♪ Star light, star bright ♪

26
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,412
And it gave her confidence.

27
00:01:31,413 --> 00:01:33,932
♪ Star light, star bright ♪

28
00:01:36,614 --> 00:01:38,593
That's why she loved pageantry,

29
00:01:38,594 --> 00:01:41,718
because you didn't have to be
the prettiest or the tallest

30
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:44,468
or the blondest or the whitest.

31
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:47,167
You just had to have fucking confidence.

32
00:01:48,385 --> 00:01:51,968
And she probably would have
gone on to win Miss Universe,

33
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:54,817
if it weren't for... this guy.

34
00:01:54,818 --> 00:01:56,227
A beauty pageant coach,

35
00:01:56,228 --> 00:01:59,593
Marcus Cutler was arrested today
on 18 counts of child molestation.

36
00:01:59,594 --> 00:02:03,134
That's it. You're done. No
more pageants. This is sick.

37
00:02:03,135 --> 00:02:05,259
Her dreams were dashed by some random,

38
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,384
50-year-old creep who didn't molest her,

39
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:09,468
let alone even meet her.

40
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:12,385
She refused to eat for
a week out of protest.

41
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:15,343
Drama!

42
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:18,857
But then she realized how much
she liked not doing anything.

43
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:21,760
Maddy would never say it out loud,

44
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:24,468
especially not today, because
everybody's so political,

45
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:30,318
but she never really had any
desire to have a career... or job.

46
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:33,676
She was just interested
in doing what she did,

47
00:02:33,677 --> 00:02:36,051
just, without school and
the other bullshit.

48
00:02:37,677 --> 00:02:39,551
Her mother was an esthetician.

49
00:02:39,552 --> 00:02:43,343
Which is a fancy way of saying she
gave pedicures to rich people.

50
00:02:43,344 --> 00:02:44,968
And her dad was a drunk,

51
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:48,119
who was always pretending to
hold jobs longer than he did.

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,343
She quickly realized that there are
two kinds of people in the world:

53
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:55,051
people who sit in the chairs
with their feet in the footbath,

54
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:58,386
and the people who kneel
in front of the footbath.

55
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:04,343
She used to sit and study
the women who came in.

56
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:06,551
She'd pay attention to what they wore,

57
00:03:06,552 --> 00:03:08,259
what they'd talk about,

58
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,802
and what she realized was that none
of them actually did anything.

59
00:03:11,803 --> 00:03:14,718
I mean, they may have,
like, children to raise

60
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,551
or homes to decorate, but
at the end of the day,

61
00:03:17,552 --> 00:03:19,802
they literally did nothing.

62
00:03:19,803 --> 00:03:22,885
They literally did...

63
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,301
nothing.

64
00:03:24,302 --> 00:03:28,218
And strangely, none of
them had confidence.

65
00:03:29,302 --> 00:03:31,468
She had had a thing
for Nate for a while,

66
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:33,760
before he finally asked her out.

67
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:35,551
And at first, he was a gentleman,

68
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,968
like, flowers every day
kind of gentleman.

69
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:40,718
- And he was smarter than most guys.
- Maddy.

70
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,593
- Plus, Nate, like, really loved her.
- You're so sweet.

71
00:03:43,594 --> 00:03:45,426
I love you.

72
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:47,635
I love you, too.

73
00:03:47,636 --> 00:03:49,134
And she did love Nate.

74
00:03:49,135 --> 00:03:51,093
She loved her relationship with Nate.

75
00:03:51,094 --> 00:03:53,760
She was also a really good girlfriend.

76
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:56,093
Granted, she didn't
always tell the truth.

77
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:57,468
You're a virgin?

78
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:00,301
Because the truth-truth
is that when she was 14,

79
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:02,760
on vacation in Panama City Beach,

80
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:05,093
she met a guy who was, like, 40.

81
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:07,218
Hey. You from around here?

82
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:10,093
Which in retrospect seems
kind of rape-y and weird,

83
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:12,384
but honestly, she was
the one in control.

84
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,187
Yeah.

85
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:15,510
She could tell by looking in Nate's eyes

86
00:04:15,511 --> 00:04:17,676
- how much it meant to him.
- Like fully?

87
00:04:17,677 --> 00:04:18,927
Yeah.

88
00:04:18,928 --> 00:04:20,968
That she was a hundred percent his.

89
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,343
What about, like, have
you ever been fingered?

90
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:27,843
Only my own.

91
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:30,802
Plus, it's not like anyone can
feel the fucking difference.

92
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:36,051
But that's the thing
with guys like Nate.

93
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:40,968
They don't actually want a person.

94
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:43,425
They want something they can own

95
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:45,343
and possess.

96
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:48,547
Like Sharon Stone in Casino.

97
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:51,927
But the cool thing about
Sharon Stone in Casino

98
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:54,218
is that she ran the fuck over De Niro.

99
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:56,051
I would fucking kill for that coat.

100
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:57,802
And she did the same to Nate.

101
00:04:57,803 --> 00:04:59,551
How much do you think it costs?

102
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:02,051
Seriously, Sharon Stone
in Casino was, like,

103
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,093
Maddy's spirit animal.

104
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:06,301
She also watched a lot of porn.

105
00:05:06,302 --> 00:05:09,927
Not because it turned her
on or anything, it didn't.

106
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:11,968
But if you analyzed it really closely,

107
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:14,343
there were a ton of really good secrets.

108
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:20,968
Sometimes, during sex,

109
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:23,010
she would imagine she
was a ventriloquist

110
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:24,635
controlling her body...

111
00:05:24,636 --> 00:05:28,259
Moving her hips and arching her
back in just the right way.

112
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,676
She wanted Nate to feel good
about the way he fucked.

113
00:05:31,677 --> 00:05:35,802
Because if you make a guy
feel confident and powerful,

114
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,885
well, they'll do anything.

115
00:05:37,886 --> 00:05:40,093
- That one.
- I got you a present.

116
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:41,176
Really?

117
00:05:41,177 --> 00:05:43,093
After dinner. It's in the car.

118
00:05:49,844 --> 00:05:52,343
Oh, my God, it's perfect!

119
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:54,719
- I fucking love you.
- I fucking love you, too.

120
00:05:58,302 --> 00:06:02,384
She did worry about the whole
monogamy thing, though.

121
00:06:02,385 --> 00:06:05,343
It's not like she ever cheated-cheated.

122
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:09,010
But every now and then, she'd find
herself in, like, a gray area.

123
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:10,802
I'll do anything to fuck you.

124
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,134
You're so sweet... but no.

125
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:15,927
Except for that DJ who said
he opened for Calvin Harris.

126
00:06:15,928 --> 00:06:18,760
And the stockbroker guy with the
family who lived on Oak Street.

127
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:21,468
And hot dude who ran the roller rink.

128
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:28,134
But honestly, those were all times

129
00:06:28,135 --> 00:06:29,843
when Nate and her were on a break.

130
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:33,426
Plus, Nate could be a real asshole.

131
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:37,343
And sometimes, Maddy fantasized
about punching Nate.

132
00:06:37,344 --> 00:06:39,635
But because of who he was as a person,

133
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:41,593
she was afraid he'd hit her back.

134
00:06:41,594 --> 00:06:44,593
Especially because he was coming
to terms with his sexuality.

135
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:46,093
You're fucking dead to me.

136
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:48,796
It's, like, the root
of a lot of violence.

137
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:52,259
And when she got home that night,

138
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,982
she felt sick to her stomach...

139
00:06:55,677 --> 00:06:57,644
like enough to throw up.

140
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:03,259
It wasn't the violence that scared her.

141
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,985
It was the fact that she
knew no matter what he did,

142
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:08,388
she'd still love him.

143
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:25,650
<b><font color="#ff0000">Sync and corrections by btsix
www.addic7ed.com</font></b>

144
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,927
Nothing in the world
comes close to opiates.

145
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:32,968
A good ES 7.5 Vicodin? Fuck.

146
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:37,093
But honestly, the best
thing I've ever had

147
00:07:37,094 --> 00:07:38,885
is fentanyl.

148
00:07:38,886 --> 00:07:43,218
And there is not a thing on the planet
Earth that compares to fentanyl.

149
00:07:44,052 --> 00:07:45,886
Except Jules.

150
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:48,510
Jules is a close second.

151
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:51,551
Jules, Jules, Jules.

152
00:07:51,552 --> 00:07:54,593
And then you know what would
be better? Jules and fentanyl.

153
00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:57,343
But I can't do both, 'cause
Jules won't have me.

154
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:00,259
So for now, I'll choose Jules.

155
00:08:04,844 --> 00:08:08,486
- Rue, dinner's ready.
- Okay.

156
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:11,510
- Are you coming?
- Yeah. No.

157
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:14,218
Yeah. For... aah... For dinner.

158
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:17,218
- Just, uh, give me a second.
- Okay.

159
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:24,218
You two have a good
time at the carnival?

160
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:28,676
- Yeah, it was cool.
- It was all right.

161
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:30,515
Rue said you got sick on the Gravitron.

162
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:31,968
I don't want to talk about it.

163
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,928
So...

164
00:08:38,636 --> 00:08:40,581
Jules slept over last night?

165
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,910
Yeah. So?

166
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:49,945
Are you two in a relationship?

167
00:08:50,627 --> 00:08:52,925
I mean, yeah, kinda.

168
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:57,555
It may not matter what I think, but...

169
00:08:58,094 --> 00:08:59,457
I really like her.

170
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:03,670
Yeah, me, too.

171
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:13,384
Baby, just take your time.

172
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:15,427
You've come a long way.

173
00:09:17,177 --> 00:09:18,396
You're delicate.

174
00:09:19,164 --> 00:09:23,413
- I'm not delicate.
- Yes, you are.

175
00:09:25,552 --> 00:09:27,927
It's fine, Mom. We, um...

176
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:32,510
We had a really long conversation
about everything, and...

177
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:35,302
we're just gonna take
things really, really slow.

178
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,259
♪ Okay, I'm Rambo, I ramshack ♪

179
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,927
♪ I'm next to that
cheese like rattraps ♪

180
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:42,635
♪ On top of that green like grass ass ♪

181
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:43,968
♪ That's over y'all head... ♪

182
00:09:47,302 --> 00:09:49,426
Yo. Looks good.

183
00:09:49,427 --> 00:09:50,927
You ready?

184
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:53,760
Um...

185
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,913
How bad does it hurt?

186
00:09:55,914 --> 00:09:57,847
It didn't hurt, like, at all.

187
00:09:58,467 --> 00:10:00,398
It's all good. I've been
doing this for years.

188
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,343
I love you, Rue,

189
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:04,134
but there's no fucking
way I'm doing that.

190
00:10:06,677 --> 00:10:10,134
I didn't know what happened
the night Jules met Tyler.

191
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:13,218
I knew it wasn't good,
but I was afraid to pry.

192
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:16,802
And selfishly, things had
been going really well.

193
00:10:16,803 --> 00:10:19,718
Show me exactly where the holdup is.

194
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,301
Granted, after the carnival,

195
00:10:21,302 --> 00:10:23,384
things got really fucking weird.

196
00:10:23,385 --> 00:10:24,968
Hey, I gotta call you back.

197
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:26,435
Slow down.

198
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:30,968
Slow down. What's happened?

199
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,708
I'll meet you out front.

200
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,727
Thank you for coming down, Mr. Jacobs.

201
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,360
Do you want to tell me what's going on?

202
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:04,999
Let's talk when we get inside.

203
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:32,886
- Cal, you okay?
- Yeah. Need a second.

204
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:42,051
Now, what had happened was...

205
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:44,594
that morning, Maddy went to school.

206
00:11:45,802 --> 00:11:48,593
What are you, the Unabomber?

207
00:11:48,594 --> 00:11:50,603
What are you, a dominatrix?

208
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,551
- No.
- I didn't mean for real, bitch.

209
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:56,135
Obviously.

210
00:11:56,927 --> 00:11:58,927
But seriously, are you okay?

211
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:01,510
Yeah. I'm just on my period.

212
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:03,551
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

213
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:07,551
And Maddy's first class was
Intro to Calc in room 202,

214
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:10,802
which unfortunately was in the
upper left wing of the school.

215
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:13,176
Is the air conditioner,
like, not working?

216
00:12:13,177 --> 00:12:16,176
It's broken. You could
always take off your hoodie.

217
00:12:16,177 --> 00:12:17,635
Now, if it was a normal day,

218
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,718
Maddy would have just
taken off her hoodie.

219
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:22,301
But since Nate choked her,

220
00:12:22,302 --> 00:12:24,301
Maddy woke up three hours early,

221
00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:26,259
applied more concealer
than a burn victim,

222
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,093
and tried her best to cover up.

223
00:12:30,844 --> 00:12:32,593
To compound the problem,

224
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:34,551
she also suffered from
a drop in serotonin

225
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:37,301
from the Molly she took at
the carnival, got depressed,

226
00:12:37,302 --> 00:12:40,843
and therefore hadn't had anything
to eat or drink the entire weekend.

227
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,635
Plus, she actually was on her period.

228
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:45,427
Maddy?

229
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:47,552
Maddy?

230
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,677
She's in here.

231
00:12:53,343 --> 00:12:57,051
I'm fine. Why is everyone,
like, so dramatic?

232
00:12:57,052 --> 00:13:00,384
Obviously, you've been
through a lot this weekend.

233
00:13:00,385 --> 00:13:03,468
But my real concern is the
bruising on your neck.

234
00:13:03,469 --> 00:13:05,510
There is no bruising on my neck.

235
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:08,806
- Mm. Paramedics saw it.
- Yeah, well, they're lying.

236
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:12,043
Madeleine, look.

237
00:13:12,803 --> 00:13:17,256
I understand that you may be afraid
to talk about how you got hurt.

238
00:13:18,216 --> 00:13:20,635
But I want you to know
that it is not your fault.

239
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:23,843
I'm trying to find a really
respectful way to say this.

240
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,760
But, um, this doesn't concern you.

241
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:29,510
It does concern me, Madeleine.

242
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:31,760
You're 17 years old.

243
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:34,176
If I suspect that you're being abused,

244
00:13:34,177 --> 00:13:36,635
I'm mandated by law to report it.

245
00:13:36,636 --> 00:13:37,886
Fuck.

246
00:13:38,844 --> 00:13:40,886
Was it someone you know?

247
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:44,248
Was it Nate Jacobs?

248
00:13:44,677 --> 00:13:47,676
All I know is she, like, knocked
over a giant pot of chili

249
00:13:47,677 --> 00:13:49,843
and, like, called his
mother the "C" word.

250
00:13:49,844 --> 00:13:52,301
I mean, he did, like,
grab her by the arm.

251
00:13:52,302 --> 00:13:54,676
Yo, straight up? The chick's crazy.

252
00:13:54,677 --> 00:13:57,010
Do you know why Nate and
Maddy were fighting?

253
00:13:57,011 --> 00:13:59,343
Um, I don't wanna talk
until I get a lawyer.

254
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:01,218
You're not being charged with anything.

255
00:14:01,219 --> 00:14:03,718
Look, Nate's gay.

256
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,259
I'm being serious, Barbara.

257
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,426
No, I'm telling you, like,
Nate's actually gay.

258
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:09,343
That's why Maddy was upset.

259
00:14:09,344 --> 00:14:10,927
I don't know about the carnival,

260
00:14:10,928 --> 00:14:14,676
but I do know she smashed some
dude in the pool at McKay's.

261
00:14:14,677 --> 00:14:15,885
Smashed?

262
00:14:15,886 --> 00:14:18,426
That's why he attacked the new girl.

263
00:14:18,427 --> 00:14:19,836
What new girl?

264
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:22,303
The one who cut herself.

265
00:14:26,052 --> 00:14:28,094
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

266
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,051
Mr. Jacobs, would you
please come with me?

267
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:35,469
- What?
- Come with me.

268
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,551
You wanna tell me what the problem is?

269
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:42,968
Don't worry. We will.

270
00:14:51,421 --> 00:14:53,056
What was that about?

271
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:55,437
Probably 'cause Nate
tried to kill Maddy.

272
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:56,468
What?

273
00:14:56,469 --> 00:14:59,259
Well, 'cause she found all
that gay porn on his phone.

274
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,010
- Who told you that?
- You did.

275
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:02,802
- When?
- At the carnival.

276
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:04,510
Okay, Lexi, never repeat that,

277
00:15:04,511 --> 00:15:06,535
because literally none of it's true.

278
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:17,883
Uh...

279
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:22,187
Daniel, I-I can't. I'm sorry.

280
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:26,133
I just... I'm... I'm
dating somebody, and...

281
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,682
I really don't want to fuck it up.

282
00:15:27,683 --> 00:15:29,419
It's cool. Don't worry.

283
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:33,635
I just like you. I kind
of thought you liked me.

284
00:15:33,636 --> 00:15:35,011
I do, I just...

285
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,013
I have a boyfriend.

286
00:15:40,944 --> 00:15:42,418
Please don't say anything.

287
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,556
If I promise not to say anything,

288
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:48,843
can we hang out again?

289
00:15:55,802 --> 00:15:57,320
...reproductive health

290
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:59,101
and your total well being

291
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:00,968
in all aspects of reproduction.

292
00:16:00,969 --> 00:16:03,301
For example, physical, emotional...

293
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:06,635
Hey. Did you get my texts?

294
00:16:06,636 --> 00:16:08,864
- No.
- Really?

295
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:13,677
- Well, I sent you a bunch of texts.
- Didn't get 'em.

296
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:17,010
Well, it says, like,
delivered on my phone.

297
00:16:17,011 --> 00:16:19,872
Look, I really don't want to
talk about this right now.

298
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,919
What, are you for real?

299
00:16:27,098 --> 00:16:28,932
Did I, like, do something?

300
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:32,159
I don't know, Ethan. Did you?

301
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:38,510
So the night of the carnival,
while fucking Luke Kasten,

302
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:40,343
Kat had an epiphany.

303
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:42,510
She was fucking Luke Kasten,

304
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:45,176
Luke motherfucking Kasten.

305
00:16:46,677 --> 00:16:49,719
And for those of you who
didn't go to East Highland...

306
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:53,802
Luke Kasten was a fucking god.

307
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:56,676
I mean, he graduated years ago
and people still talk about him.

308
00:16:56,677 --> 00:16:58,885
He has the biggest dick I've ever seen,

309
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:01,010
and I was looking at him
while he was fucking me.

310
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:04,384
I could see his face scrunching up when
he was coming all over my stomach,

311
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:08,468
and I had this, like, realization,
you know, like, this epiphany.

312
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:11,425
That no matter how cool, or, or sexy

313
00:17:11,426 --> 00:17:14,760
or, or smart you think a guy is,

314
00:17:14,761 --> 00:17:17,034
they're actually just fucking pathetic.

315
00:17:18,322 --> 00:17:19,968
It's true, KittenKween.

316
00:17:19,969 --> 00:17:22,218
Oh.

317
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:24,927
By the way, if you wanna come,

318
00:17:24,928 --> 00:17:27,051
I put a body harness on
my Amazon wish list.

319
00:17:27,052 --> 00:17:28,644
I'm gonna need you to buy it for me.

320
00:17:28,645 --> 00:17:31,218
Yes, KittenKween.

321
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:33,760
- Can I be honest with you?
- Always.

322
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,134
- What I realize is that, like...
- Where are you going?

323
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:38,927
...my whole life, all I've tried
to do is to take up less space.

324
00:17:38,928 --> 00:17:40,301
To the mall.

325
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:42,093
Try to hide from guys,
like, who might, like,

326
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,278
whisper to their friend under
their breath as I walked by.

327
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,086
I've spent my whole life afraid people

328
00:17:47,087 --> 00:17:48,676
were gonna find out that I was fat.

329
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:50,718
But honestly, who gives a shit?

330
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:53,176
I'm so in awe of you, KittenKween.

331
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:55,565
There's nothing more
powerful than a fat girl

332
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:56,885
who doesn't give a fuck.

00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:52,169
Then who did?

350
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,968
- It wasn't Nate.
- Maddy, stop lying.

351
00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:56,134
- I'm not lying!
- I am not gonna let the son of a bitch

352
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,343
attack my daughter and get away with it.

353
00:18:58,344 --> 00:18:59,802
- Right?
- Absolutely.

354
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:01,355
He needs to know that
there are consequences.

355
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:02,844
- Mom!
- I would like to press charges.

356
00:19:02,845 --> 00:19:04,384
Well, you're not fucking
pressing charges!

357
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:06,176
- I am gonna press charges.
- No, you're not pressing...

358
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:08,343
- This is for your own good!
- No, you're not pressing charges!

359
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:10,510
O-Okay!

360
00:19:10,511 --> 00:19:12,677
I would like to press charges.

361
00:19:16,495 --> 00:19:20,078
- You okay, Mr. Jacobs?
- I'm fine.

362
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:25,093
Mr. and Mrs. Jacobs,

363
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:27,218
thanks for getting here so quickly.

364
00:19:28,552 --> 00:19:31,218
So, it appears that
your son and Miss Perez

365
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:33,968
had a physical altercation
on Saturday night,

366
00:19:33,969 --> 00:19:35,843
in which he allegedly strangled her.

367
00:19:35,844 --> 00:19:36,636
What?

368
00:19:36,637 --> 00:19:38,927
There are multiple eyewitnesses.

369
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,593
Miss Perez has extensive bruising,

370
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:43,718
and the family will be pressing charges.

371
00:19:45,302 --> 00:19:47,968
There must be some misunderstanding.

372
00:19:47,969 --> 00:19:50,718
This doesn't sound like
something my son would do.

373
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:53,176
I would like to talk
to the Perez family.

374
00:19:53,177 --> 00:19:54,885
Actually, Mr. Jacobs,

375
00:19:54,886 --> 00:19:57,051
I think it'd be best
to speak to your son

376
00:19:57,052 --> 00:19:59,384
before we take him to the station.

377
00:19:59,385 --> 00:20:01,469
He's just this way.

378
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:37,148
Did you do it?

379
00:20:40,596 --> 00:20:42,134
Not really.

380
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:45,660
Did you admit to it?

381
00:20:48,015 --> 00:20:49,182
No.

382
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:54,541
Did you do it?

383
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,337
No.

384
00:21:07,739 --> 00:21:10,530
Well, that's good to hear.

385
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,733
Her family's gonna press charges.

386
00:21:19,296 --> 00:21:21,212
- Fuck.
- Hey.

387
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:25,551
Listen to me.

388
00:21:26,923 --> 00:21:28,774
You need to stay composed.

389
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,306
Don't get angry, don't make a scene.

390
00:21:31,307 --> 00:21:33,892
You walk out of the school
with your head held high.

391
00:21:36,402 --> 00:21:39,778
Look at me. Hey, look at me.

392
00:21:43,072 --> 00:21:45,531
What's about to happen to you...

393
00:21:46,343 --> 00:21:47,811
to me, to our family...

394
00:21:48,677 --> 00:21:50,671
is not gonna be easy.

395
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:54,790
You walk out first.

396
00:21:55,283 --> 00:21:56,801
I'm right behind you.

397
00:21:58,401 --> 00:21:59,473
Go on.

398
00:22:15,218 --> 00:22:17,170
I love you.

399
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:28,176

00:22:57,427 --> 00:22:59,218
Okay, one: what was that about?

408
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:02,802
Two: can we talk about the fact
that you fucked Nate's dad?

409
00:23:02,803 --> 00:23:07,010
Rue, swear to God, like, on your life
that you will never tell anyone.

410
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,885
- That you fucked Nate's dad.
- I'm serious!

411
00:23:09,886 --> 00:23:11,760
This is like, like,

412
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:14,010
even if you decide you hate me one day,

413
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:15,635
like, you can never tell anyone.

414
00:23:16,317 --> 00:23:17,849
How would I ever hate you?

415
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:21,155
That's not the point. Like...

416
00:23:21,908 --> 00:23:24,689
Seriously, this is some
go-to-your-grave shit.

417
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:26,622
I promise.

418
00:23:28,969 --> 00:23:30,469
Okay.

419
00:23:32,093 --> 00:23:33,430
Do you think Nate knows?

420
00:23:34,198 --> 00:23:36,183
No. Why would Nate know?

421
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:39,510
I don't know. You went up to the
chili booth at the carnival.

422
00:23:39,511 --> 00:23:41,897
Did... he look like he knew?

423
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,104
No, like, literally, I
didn't even notice.

424
00:23:51,469 --> 00:23:52,969
Nate's scary.

425
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:57,177
The whole fucking family is scary.

426
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:03,395
I don't want to have this conversation.

427
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:09,218
You know what would be amazing?
If they paid you off

428
00:24:09,219 --> 00:24:11,688
with a bunch of money and we do
a bunch of really cool shit.

429
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:17,265
Rue, this isn't a joke.

430
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,551
I don't know why Jules didn't trust me

431
00:24:31,552 --> 00:24:34,093
or why she'd think I'd ever hate her.

432
00:24:34,094 --> 00:24:35,843
There's literally nothing in the world

433
00:24:35,844 --> 00:24:39,593
that Jules could do to make me
upset. I even told her that.

434
00:24:39,594 --> 00:24:42,719
- Yeah, right.
- No, for real. It's true.

435
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,886
So, like, do you have a
lot of one-night stands?

436
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:55,385
Um, define a lot.

437
00:24:56,552 --> 00:24:58,384
Um, like...

438
00:24:58,385 --> 00:25:01,006
- More than five.
- Yeah.

439
00:25:01,787 --> 00:25:03,579
More than ten.

440
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:05,793
I don't know.

441
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:08,047
More than 20.

442
00:25:08,927 --> 00:25:12,176
- Rue, why does it matter?
- It's just a question.

443
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,052
Who cares?

444
00:25:15,552 --> 00:25:17,593
Is the sex, like, good?

445
00:25:17,594 --> 00:25:21,093
I don't know. It's, like, it's
not even the point, you know?

446
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:25,551
It's more about, like,
everything that leads up to it.

447
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:27,927
That's the good part.

448
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:32,466
I mean, you've had
one-night stands, right?

449
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:34,529
No.

450
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,842
But you've, like, hooked up with people

451
00:25:36,843 --> 00:25:40,176
- that you've just met, right?
- Uh, not... Not like that. No. No.

452
00:25:40,177 --> 00:25:43,552
Wait. How many people
have you slept with?

453
00:25:44,385 --> 00:25:45,676
Not many.

454
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,551
No, like, what's your number?

455
00:25:48,552 --> 00:25:51,010
Ugh, this is so embarrassing.

456
00:25:55,802 --> 00:25:58,218
I had my first kiss at the age of 12

457
00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:00,218
with a boy I didn't really like, but...

458
00:26:00,219 --> 00:26:03,426
I just wanted to get it over with.

459
00:26:03,427 --> 00:26:05,968
I gave four hand jobs in eighth grade,

460
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:07,301
two blow jobs in ninth,

461
00:26:07,302 --> 00:26:10,176
one of which I was
emotionally coerced into.

462
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:12,468
I'm literally gonna tell the entire
school that you sucked my dick,

463
00:26:12,469 --> 00:26:13,999
so you might as well just suck my dick.

464
00:26:15,094 --> 00:26:18,093
Then there was that time that Lexi
got asked to the freshman formal

465
00:26:18,094 --> 00:26:21,594
by Tucker Blake and I tried to
teach her how to French kiss.

466
00:26:24,011 --> 00:26:27,390
Is this, like, really weird
and uncomfortable for you?

467
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,093
Mm, no. Not really.

468
00:26:30,094 --> 00:26:32,969
Okay. Um, I'm gonna get ready.

469
00:26:38,135 --> 00:26:40,093
Also, at 15,

470
00:26:40,094 --> 00:26:45,134
I ate two Xannie bars, drank a
beer, which is super dangerous,

471
00:26:45,135 --> 00:26:46,760
and lost my virginity.

472
00:26:48,385 --> 00:26:51,886
- Did you come?
- Yeah.

473
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:54,677
Word.

474
00:26:57,218 --> 00:27:00,301
You look like you came hard.

475
00:27:00,302 --> 00:27:05,510
All I know is, life is not
a Nicholas Sparks novel.

476
00:27:06,343 --> 00:27:09,469
- That's it?
- Yep. That's... That's it.

477
00:27:11,594 --> 00:27:15,635
Wait, so, like... have
you ever been in love?

478
00:27:22,552 --> 00:27:24,343
Fucking pigs!

479
00:27:24,344 --> 00:27:26,176
Fuck you!

480
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:30,510
Hi, Maddy. I'm Detective Riley.
I understand this is traumatic,

481
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:32,343
but you're gonna have to cooperate.

482
00:27:32,344 --> 00:27:34,436
If you literally step any
closer, I will fight you!

483
00:27:34,437 --> 00:27:38,093
Miss, this is procedure. I need
you to remove your sweater now,

484
00:27:38,094 --> 00:27:40,510
and if you don't, we
will remove it for you.

485
00:27:40,511 --> 00:27:43,011
Really, bitch? How?

486
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,843
- You're fucking crazy!
- Calm down.

487
00:27:45,844 --> 00:27:47,635
Take a deep breath. Take a deep breath.

488
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:49,718
Come on, Maddy. We don't
want to hurt you.

489
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:51,093
Get off of me!

490
00:27:51,094 --> 00:27:53,404
- Maddy, please.
- Relax.

491
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,607
There we go.

492
00:27:54,608 --> 00:27:56,552
Thanks, guys. I got this.

493
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,468
I know you're really upset right now,

494
00:28:22,469 --> 00:28:24,218
and you don't want to hear this.

495
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:27,761
But trust me, when I tell you
that the person that did this...

496
00:28:28,594 --> 00:28:31,135
...doesn't love you.

497
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,927
Mm-hmm.

498
00:28:42,761 --> 00:28:44,384
So you grabbed her.

499
00:28:44,385 --> 00:28:48,075
I grabbed her by the arm to drag
her away. I didn't choke her.

500
00:28:50,969 --> 00:28:53,426
I asked her why she was acting that way.

501
00:28:53,427 --> 00:28:55,460
Like, I asked her what she was doing.

502
00:28:59,469 --> 00:29:01,258
I don't want to get her in any trouble,

503
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:03,136
but she'd taken a lot of drugs.

504
00:29:03,816 --> 00:29:05,101
What drugs?

505
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,594
I don't want to get her in trouble.

506
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:11,594
She's not gonna get in any trouble.

507
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:15,093
Molly.

508
00:29:15,968 --> 00:29:18,092
As in MDMA?

509
00:29:18,093 --> 00:29:19,469
Yeah.

510
00:29:20,284 --> 00:29:22,409
But I don't know if it was pure.

511
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,035
Like, I don't... I don't
do drugs, so I don't know.

512
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,718
And after that conversation,
was that the last time

513
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:33,912
you spoke to Miss Perez that evening?

514
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:35,896
Yeah.

515
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:49,477
Her and I don't have the
healthiest relationship.

516
00:29:50,802 --> 00:29:52,021
I know that.

517
00:29:53,177 --> 00:29:57,063
My dad's always telling me that she's
a distraction, and he's right.

518
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:02,510
I love her.

519
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:05,093
You know, I really
love her. No matter...

520
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:08,510
how crazy she acts, no matter
what she does, I love her.

521
00:30:15,451 --> 00:30:18,543
It's kind of embarrassing
to admit, but, um...

522
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,843
on the times when we've broken up,

523
00:30:23,844 --> 00:30:26,844
I know for a fact that she's
been with other guys.

524
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:32,008
I don't know, I mean, it's
possible that that night...

525
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:39,667
Aah, it doesn't matter.

526
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:44,285
- What were you gonna say?
- It doesn't matter.

527
00:30:46,298 --> 00:30:47,738
I love Maddy.

528
00:30:48,302 --> 00:30:50,350
I'd never do anything to hurt her.

529
00:30:51,135 --> 00:30:53,724
The fallout from Nate's
assault was swift...

530
00:30:53,725 --> 00:30:54,943
I'm suspending your son

531
00:30:54,944 --> 00:30:56,177
until the investigation is completed.

532
00:30:56,178 --> 00:30:58,176
Look, that could take months.

533
00:30:58,177 --> 00:30:59,676
...and harsh.

534
00:30:59,677 --> 00:31:03,218
East Highland football team
has a zero tolerance policy.

535
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:05,552
I'm a survivor of abuse.

536
00:31:06,802 --> 00:31:10,134
It took me ten years to admit that.

537
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:12,551
Because the most insidious
symptom of abuse

538
00:31:12,552 --> 00:31:16,802
is the inability to admit
that what you're enduring

539
00:31:16,803 --> 00:31:19,176
is not normal,

540
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:22,761
not okay, and not love.

541
00:31:24,385 --> 00:31:27,176
Those are the moments that
keep me up at night...

542
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:30,010
Thinking about all the
times that I ignored that,

543
00:31:30,011 --> 00:31:33,093
that voice in my head.

544
00:31:33,094 --> 00:31:36,177
You know, that told me,
"What are you doing?"

545
00:31:37,677 --> 00:31:41,259
And what happens in a month?
Six months? A year?

546
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,343
When she moves away and goes to college?

547
00:31:44,344 --> 00:31:48,093
When she tells you, she
just wants to be friends?

548
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:52,844
- You mean "if."
- No, Rue. I mean "when."

549
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,760
I mean, I don't know. We
talked about living together.

550
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:59,593
Like, if she goes to New
York, I'll just go with her.

551
00:31:59,594 --> 00:32:01,048
I'll go anywhere she goes.

552
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:02,636
I think you're missing my point, Rue.

553
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:07,302
Nothing in high school lasts forever.

554
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:14,177
You should meet her.

555
00:32:18,093 --> 00:32:20,593
Go ahead, Rue.

556
00:32:20,594 --> 00:32:23,343
♪ What the fuck are we talking for? ♪

557
00:32:23,344 --> 00:32:24,886
Uh...

558
00:32:25,427 --> 00:32:28,843
Hey, everyone. I'm... I'm
Rue and I'm an addict.

559
00:32:28,844 --> 00:32:31,011
Hi, Rue.

560
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,457
Uh...

561
00:32:35,886 --> 00:32:39,726
I guess I just wanted to, uh,
make amends with everyone.

562
00:32:40,886 --> 00:32:44,843
Because most every time I've shared,

563
00:32:44,844 --> 00:32:46,107
I... I was lying.

564
00:32:47,343 --> 00:32:50,718
Yeah, every time I collected a chip,

565
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,968
whether it be 30 days
or 60 days or 90 days,

566
00:32:53,969 --> 00:32:55,748
I was lying.

567
00:32:56,459 --> 00:32:57,793
Um...

568
00:33:03,077 --> 00:33:06,336
But... I met someone.

569
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,507
And she's helped.

570
00:33:12,135 --> 00:33:14,913
And now I want to stay clean.

571
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:19,718
And, shit, maybe that's...
Maybe that's me being selfish,

572
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:23,259
you know, and Ali just
scared the shit out of me.

573
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,480
'Cause he told me that
it wasn't gonna last.

574
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:29,000
And, fuck, you know what?

575
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:32,112
Maybe you're right.

576
00:33:34,177 --> 00:33:36,936
But I really, really,
really hope you're wrong.

577
00:33:40,302 --> 00:33:44,514
'Cause, uh, I've been clean for 13 days.

578
00:33:47,421 --> 00:33:48,704
It's been okay.

579
00:33:49,219 --> 00:33:51,484
Um, I've actually been really happy.

580
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,123
So, um...

581
00:33:56,124 --> 00:33:59,372
Yeah, I don't know. I guess that's
why I wanted to come here, and...

582
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:02,541
tell you guys the truth.

583
00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:08,083
Uh, thank you.

584
00:34:10,242 --> 00:34:11,740
Thank you.

585
00:34:11,741 --> 00:34:14,491
- Welcome back.
- Thank you, Rue.

586
00:34:16,677 --> 00:34:20,618
So, is this like a friend thing
with Rue or is it, like...

587
00:34:21,635 --> 00:34:23,705
I don't want to talk about it.

588
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:26,441
I was just wondering...

589
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,177
are you two, like, a thing?

590
00:34:33,927 --> 00:34:37,593
No, we're not a thing. I
don't know what a thing is.

591
00:34:37,594 --> 00:34:40,156
'Cause I've been thinking,
you know, if it was,

592
00:34:40,157 --> 00:34:42,297
if you two were a thing...

593
00:34:43,094 --> 00:34:46,010
We could all just do, like,
a family thing together.

594
00:34:46,011 --> 00:34:47,760
Maybe go out to dinner or something.

595
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:50,010
I don't want to go to
dinner with you and Rue.

596
00:34:50,011 --> 00:34:51,357
I'm sorry.

597
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:54,151
Why? Because you're embarrassed of me?

598
00:34:55,022 --> 00:34:57,397
Or is it because you're a thing?

599
00:35:00,052 --> 00:35:03,268
- You're hilarious.
- Yeah, I know.

600
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,911
Is she still going to meetings?

601
00:35:08,711 --> 00:35:10,085
That's great.

602
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:13,334
You're a good influence.

603

606
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:17,718
McKay had heard the news about Nate.

607
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,343
Had a bunch of dick pics on his phone.

608
00:36:21,385 --> 00:36:23,927
And was, like, what, sending
them to other girls?

609
00:36:23,928 --> 00:36:27,286
No, McKay, it wasn't his dick.
It was other guys' dicks.

610
00:36:27,996 --> 00:36:29,676
I'm confused. Who told you this?

611
00:36:29,677 --> 00:36:31,510
What dick pics?

612
00:36:31,511 --> 00:36:33,885
The ones you told me
about, on his phone.

613
00:36:33,886 --> 00:36:35,885
I don't know if your
brain is all scrambled

614
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:39,384
from, like, all the Molly you
take, but I never said that.

615
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:43,276
If you spread a lie like that,
I will fucking come for you.

616
00:36:43,277 --> 00:36:44,510
We good?

617
00:36:44,511 --> 00:36:46,718
Yeah.

618
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:48,596
Anyway, look, Cassie,

619
00:36:48,597 --> 00:36:51,189
I'm really sorry about what happened
the other night at the carnival.

620
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,093
It's okay.

621
00:36:56,385 --> 00:36:58,416
No, I should have said
something to Nate.

622
00:37:01,814 --> 00:37:04,599
It just really hurt my feelings.

623
00:37:05,352 --> 00:37:08,619
It made me feel like you weren't
proud to be my boyfriend.

624
00:37:14,052 --> 00:37:15,343
Cass.

625
00:37:17,886 --> 00:37:19,498
Give me a kiss.

626
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:25,635
I'm proud to be your
boyfriend, trust me.

627
00:37:29,256 --> 00:37:30,850
I'm sorry, too.

628
00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:33,769
What do you got to be sorry about?

629
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,836
I love making music.

630
00:37:40,837 --> 00:37:43,426
Yeah, I mean, but to be honest...

631
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:47,010
I don't think I'm, like, good
enough yet to just do music.

632
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:50,011
But that's, like, my dream,
you know or whatever.

633
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:57,418
- What about you?
- What about me?

634
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:00,968
You look like you're
creative or something.

635
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:02,468
Uh, you know?

636
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:05,301
- Creative.
- Yeah.

637
00:38:05,302 --> 00:38:08,719
I don't know. Just, like, the
way you dress and stuff.

638
00:38:09,385 --> 00:38:11,416
I just thought you might
be an artist or something.

639
00:38:14,706 --> 00:38:18,396
Look, if you wanna hook
up, we can hook up.

640
00:38:20,677 --> 00:38:25,218
Um... I wasn't expecting that.

641
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,506
Really?

642
00:38:27,312 --> 00:38:29,166
Yeah, I was just making conversation.

643
00:38:30,218 --> 00:38:33,719

you don't really have to.

Maddy has sent Nate a total
of 273 text messages,

none of which he answered.

650
00:38:53,451 --> 00:38:55,760

Sometimes it feels good,
sometimes it doesn't.

Nate loves me no matter what.

He'd fucking kill for me
and I'd kill for him.

that there's one person

in this whole fucked-up world

662
00:39:23,803 --> 00:39:25,510

00:45:26,402 --> 00:45:28,236
Mm.

750
00:45:33,635 --> 00:45:35,890
Do you think this stuff affects them?

751

Even if they don't know it?

752
00:45:41,381 --> 00:45:43,214
I don't know.

753
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:48,249
Do you think hiding it creates
the same thing in them?

754
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,489
Honey, I don't know.

755
00:45:51,609 --> 00:45:53,316
Everyone knows who I am.

756
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,471
You know...

757
00:46:07,058 --> 00:46:11,182
I spent my whole life trying to
keep this part of me separate.

758
00:46:13,677 --> 00:46:16,281
But I feel like it's
poisoned everything.

759
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,718
I thought that

760
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:24,552
I was doing what was best for everybody.

761
00:46:25,469 --> 00:46:28,206
And then, I look at my boys, and...

762
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:31,265
they have so much anger.

763
00:46:33,385 --> 00:46:35,011
Not just anger...

764
00:46:36,609 --> 00:46:38,484
but rage.

765
00:46:39,568 --> 00:46:41,496
And it scares me.

766
00:46:44,094 --> 00:46:47,718

Christopher McKay's father
demanded excellence.

832
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:51,300
Then he got to college
and he realized...

833
00:53:51,301 --> 00:53:53,343
he didn't stand a chance of going pro.

834
00:53:54,261 --> 00:53:56,046

836
00:53:57,448 --> 00:54:00,135
The whole point of Halloween
is to look attractive.

837
00:54:03,135 --> 00:54:04,760
The situation with your son,

838
00:54:04,761 --> 00:54:06,135
a lot of people are talking.

839
00:54:06,136 --> 00:54:07,632
You need a plan.

840
00:54:10,469 --> 00:54:13,260
Every time I feel good, I
think it'll last forever.

841
00:54:13,939 --> 00:54:15,022
But it doesn't.

842
00:54:26,677 --> 00:54:29,384
I was drawn to Maddy as a
character because I knew

843
00:54:29,385 --> 00:54:31,385
she would pull me out
of my comfort zone.

844
00:54:31,844 --> 00:54:34,259
I think Maddy's always been confident.

845
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,468
Like when she was a little girl,

846
00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:38,885
she was winning pageant after pageant.

847
00:54:38,886 --> 00:54:42,427
So, I think her confidence is
something that she's always had.

848
00:54:43,177 --> 00:54:45,886
Like I think Maddy definitely runs Nate.

849
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,968
She definitely gets what
she wants out of him,

850
00:54:47,969 --> 00:54:52,010
but in those moments where
he gets angry and violent

851
00:54:52,011 --> 00:54:53,301
and dark, she just...

852
00:54:53,302 --> 00:54:56,301
she's so weak, and I
think she's in pain.

853
00:54:56,302 --> 00:54:59,135
She's in a toxic, abusive relationship.

854
00:54:59,969 --> 00:55:02,011
It wasn't the violence that scared her.

855
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:05,135
It was the fact that she
knew no matter what he did,

856
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,886
she'd still love him.

857
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:09,760
She thinks that what
Nate provides for her

858
00:55:09,761 --> 00:55:12,426
and does for her is 100 times better

859
00:55:12,427 --> 00:55:14,385
than what she's seen her dad do.

860
00:55:14,761 --> 00:55:16,719
Growing up in a dysfunctional home,

861
00:55:17,218 --> 00:55:19,093
you can end up in those relationships

862
00:55:19,094 --> 00:55:21,176
because they either seem normal to you,

863
00:55:21,177 --> 00:55:23,989
or they seem better than
what you've seen at home.

864
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:26,134
Maddy will do anything in her power

865
00:55:26,135 --> 00:55:28,010
not to end up like her parents.

866
00:55:28,011 --> 00:55:31,635
She doesn't want that life, so
she's... she's trying to find

867
00:55:31,636 --> 00:55:34,218
a way out in any way
she can and I think...

868
00:55:34,552 --> 00:55:36,927
that's where the relationship
with Nate comes in.

869
00:55:36,928 --> 00:55:39,447
I think she likes the idea of it.

870
00:55:39,448 --> 00:55:41,218
So even though he's
hurting her, she just...

871
00:55:41,552 --> 00:55:44,427
She thinks it's better than
what she's grown up watching.

872
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:47,676
Just saying love is a million things!

873
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,551
Sometimes, it feels good.
Sometimes, it doesn't.

874
00:55:50,552 --> 00:55:53,552
Trust me when I tell you that
the person that did this

875
00:55:53,886 --> 00:55:54,927
doesn't love you.

876
00:55:55,761 --> 00:55:58,415
I think Maddy feels like
everyone's against her,

877
00:55:58,416 --> 00:56:00,176
and no one understands them.

878
00:56:00,177 --> 00:56:03,426
It feels like the lowest
point of her life,

879
00:56:03,427 --> 00:56:08,510
and even then, she's... She's
still rooting for Nate.

880
00:56:08,511 --> 00:56:10,510
She wants him to figure out a plan.

881
00:56:10,511 --> 00:56:12,011
She wants him to be okay.

882
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:16,551
She really feels like they
have this special bond,

883
00:56:16,552 --> 00:56:20,093
but it's... you know, it's a
dysfunctional young love.

884
00:56:25,302 --> 00:56:27,551
Working with Jacob was incredible.

885
00:56:27,552 --> 00:56:30,781
I couldn't have asked for
a better scene partner.

886
00:56:30,782 --> 00:56:35,051
Those scenes are really intense,
and you know, it is...

887
00:56:35,052 --> 00:56:38,468
It's acting, but it's
physical and you know,

888
00:56:38,469 --> 00:56:41,510
you're pouring all of
your emotion into this.

889
00:56:42,302 --> 00:56:44,218
I think Maddy's searching for

890
00:56:44,219 --> 00:56:46,593
any bit of love, any bit of hope.

891
00:56:46,594 --> 00:56:50,343
I think we want love sometimes so bad,

892
00:56:50,344 --> 00:56:52,176
we stay in these relationships

893
00:56:52,177 --> 00:56:54,218
even when we know they aren't right.

894
00:56:54,219 --> 00:56:57,030
But she doesn't want to
admit that to herself.

895
00:56:57,031 --> 00:56:58,843
She just wants everybody
to leave her alone,

896
00:56:58,844 --> 00:57:00,635
and she wants it to
just be her and Nate.
