2
00:00:51,736 --> 00:00:55,823
I don't understand why we have to drive
seven hours to see a psychiatrist.

3
00:00:57,742 --> 00:01:01,243
Because... we want the
best care possible for you.

4
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:03,537
<i>When Jules was
eleven years old,</i>

5
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,583
<i>her mother took her on a road trip.</i>

6
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,525
- Wasn't Dali, like, a sexual predator?
- Was he?

7
00:01:32,735 --> 00:01:34,276
I hadn't heard that before.

8
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:36,362
Would you like me to take it down?

9
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:38,822
No. It's a cool painting.

10
00:01:38,824 --> 00:01:40,616
It is a cool painting.

11
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:42,368
<i>He was actually
really sweet, though.</i>

12
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,662
<i>They talked for over an hour,</i>

13
00:01:44,664 --> 00:01:48,042
<i>and only later did Jules realize
that she hadn't lied once.</i>

14
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:58,761
<i>After the session, they wanted
to give her a tour of the Unit.</i>

15
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,684
- Well, what's the Unit?
- Think of it like a second home,

16
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:09,603
where children can learn how
to feel better about themselves.

17
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:11,313
Okay.

18
00:02:11,315 --> 00:02:12,900
Let me give you a tour.

19
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:18,153
So, this is our common area,

20
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:20,364
where we have group sessions,

21
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:22,783
watch movies, play games,

22
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:24,868
have art class.

23
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,747
Um, on Tuesdays we have
canine therapy.

24
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,544
Uh, Thursdays we have music therapy.

25
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:41,053
- Dr. Kay!
- Allan!

26
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:44,181
Suck my dick, you fucking cunt!

27
00:02:46,058 --> 00:02:47,935
Allan!

28
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:54,565
Usually there's two to a room,

29
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:57,069
depending on how many patients
are with us.

30
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:04,908
So the kids live here?

31
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,828
For short periods of time.

32
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,207
And this is the quiet room.

33
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:15,210
I'm gonna fucking
rape you, Dr. Kay!

34
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:18,881
You just bought yourself another
30 minutes in the quiet room, Jesse.

35
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:20,674
<i>It was around
then when Jules thought</i>

36
00:03:20,676 --> 00:03:23,052
<i>she had just about
had enough of the tour.</i>

37
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:24,430
I think I wanna go home.

38
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:31,562
<i>And that's when Jules realized,
this wasn't a tour at all.</i>

39
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:34,730
<i>It was an elaborate plan
to admit her</i>

40
00:03:34,732 --> 00:03:37,775
<i>to a fucking psychiatric hospital.</i>

41
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:40,569
Mom! Mom!

42
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:43,113
No, no, no, no, no!

43
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:48,118
No! No! No!

44
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,037
<i>During the ensuing
struggle, Jules accidentally</i>

45
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,914
<i>scratched an RA across the face,</i>

46
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,460
<i>which she felt really guilty about.</i>

47
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,840
<i>But quickly, that guilt
turned into anger...</i>

48
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:04,553
<i>and that anger, into defeat.</i>

49
00:04:06,597 --> 00:04:08,973
Hi. I'm Jules.

50
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:11,850
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

51
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,144
Good. Good.

52
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:17,690
Why don't you tell the group a little
about yourself and why you're here.

53
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,316
I don't know.

54
00:04:19,318 --> 00:04:23,696
Maybe because I was, like,
sad for a really long time.

55
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:25,364
What do you mean by a long time?

56
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:28,575
Maybe since I was
seven or eight or something.

57
00:04:28,577 --> 00:04:31,745
And I've been to see,
like, a bunch of doctors.

58
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:33,580
I've been on, like,
a bunch of medications,

59
00:04:33,582 --> 00:04:35,958
but nothing's really helped, so...

60
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,377
Maybe these mitts will do the trick.

61
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:41,716
And, Jules, do you self-injure?

62
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:46,387
<i>The truth was,
Jules hated herself.</i>

63
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:50,349
<i>She hated
how her brain worked...</i>

64
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:54,560
<i>the way it would
get stuck on a thought,</i>

65
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:56,230
<i>like choking.</i>

66
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,944
All right. Keep present.

67
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:06,488
<i>And it would just play
on an infinite loop,</i>

68
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,616
<i>until she couldn't think</i>

69
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:10,618
<i>or breathe or stand to be alive.</i>

70
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,579
This is hard, Jules.
You're going to get through it, okay?

71
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:15,414
<i>She didn't just
hate her brain, though.</i>

72
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,667
<i>She hated her body, not every part,</i>

73
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:21,295
<i>just her shoulders, and her arms,</i>

74
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:23,172
<i>and her hands.</i>

75
00:05:23,174 --> 00:05:26,300
<i>Also her chest,
her stomach, her thighs.</i>

76
00:05:26,302 --> 00:05:27,968
<i>Her knees were the worst.</i>

77
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,515
<i>Plus her ankles, and her big,
fucking, stupid feet.</i>

78
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:37,144
<i>She hated her life,
not because it was bad,</i>

79
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:40,147
<i>but because when you hate
your brain and your body,</i>

80
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:42,608
<i>it's hard to enjoy the rest.</i>

81
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,528
<i>So, Jules developed
a few coping mechanisms.</i>

82
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,492
<i>None of them healthy, and a few
scary enough to land her in...</i>

83
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:57,873
So, how are you liking the Unit?

84
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,293
It's okay.

85
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:03,047
- Are you making any friends?
- Not really.

86
00:06:04,215 --> 00:06:06,423
Well, that'll change.

87
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:08,469
Wait. Can you leave
me the rest?

88
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:12,848
Sure.

89
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:43,963
- This guy did some damage.
- Allan?

90
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:47,631
I did something really stupid.

91
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:50,050
Is everything okay?

92
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:51,887
I'm so sorry.

93
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:54,682
Please don't be mad at me.

94
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:07,486
<i>Eventually Jules got
better and came home.</i>

95
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,911
<i>But her mom got
worse and went away.</i>

96
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:22,916
<i>And her dad quit his
job to be closer to home,</i>

97
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:26,170
<i>which she liked,
'cause she loved her dad.</i>

98
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:29,340
<i>By 13, she started to transition.</i>

99
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:33,719
<i>And by 16, Jules had gotten
a little slutty.</i>

100
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:36,013
<i>And every guy was the same:</i>

101
00:07:36,015 --> 00:07:38,807
<i>cis, white, married,</i>

102
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:41,852
<i>engaged, in long-term relationships,</i>

103
00:07:41,854 --> 00:07:43,604
<i>and always, always...</i>

104
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:46,943
I mean,
I'm a hundred percent straight.

105
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:50,863
Um, cool.

106
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:54,951
So do you like top?

107
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:59,119
- No.
- Cool.

108
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:01,540
'Cause that's, like, not my thing.

109
00:08:13,886 --> 00:08:17,014
<i>Some were sweet.
Some were weird.</i>

110
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:19,642
<i>And a few were aggressive.</i>

111
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,353
Spit.

112
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:27,608
<i>And whenever anything
got too uncomfortable...</i>

113
00:08:29,485 --> 00:08:32,361
<i>...Jules would just imagine
that she wasn't really herself,</i>

114
00:08:32,363 --> 00:08:35,239
<i>and this wasn't really her life.</i>

115
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:39,326
<i>She was just a character
in a book or a movie or a show.</i>

116
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:43,539
<i>That none of it was real, and
if it was, how did it matter?</i>

117
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,168
<i>It's not like her body ever really
belonged to her in the first place.</i>

118
00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:53,551
<i>But fuck it.
She'd save it for the memoirs.</i>

119
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:59,555
<i>'Cause that was the night
she met her new best friend.</i>

120
00:08:59,557 --> 00:09:02,391
<i>And although she had never
really been in a relationship</i>

121
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:04,893
<i>or even in, like, love,</i>

122
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:08,439
<i>she imagined spending
the rest of her life with her.</i>

123
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:11,567
<i>How they'd live together in
some shitty New York apartment,</i>

124
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:15,446
<i>and maybe date other people, but
always sleep in the same bed.</i>

125
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:19,116
<i>She even said it to her once,
which was probably a mistake,</i>

126
00:09:19,118 --> 00:09:21,662
<i>for, like, a lot of reasons.</i>

127
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:26,206
<i>Plus, that was before
she fell for Tyler,</i>

128
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,920
<i>like, hard, like, really hard.</i>

129
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:37,468
What are you smiling about?

130
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,181
I don't know.
Just... life.

131
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:05,623
<i>There's nothing I'm
really passionate about.</i>

132
00:10:06,832 --> 00:10:11,251
You know, like, I'm not dying
to say or do anything, really.

133
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:13,462
And every time
I admit that to people,

134
00:10:13,464 --> 00:10:16,090
they're like, "Oh, my gosh,
that's so sad." But...

135
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:18,968
I think that's the case
for most people.

136
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,013
You know? Like, when I look
at my mom or...

137
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:24,974
like, the kids at my school...

138
00:10:24,976 --> 00:10:28,813
like, their profiles or their
posts and their Tumblr rants...

139
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:35,109
you realize they're all just
fucked up, too... and lost.

140
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:38,612
They just have
a reason to mask it...

141
00:10:38,614 --> 00:10:41,323
whether it be, like,
their, their families

142
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:45,121
or their boyfriends
or their hashtag activism.

143
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,832
And they're just reaching
for something

144
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:52,084
- to make it all seem meaningful.
- Rue...

145
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,003
But sometimes
I just sit and think...

146
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:55,879
- Rue. Rue.
- ...like, what's the point?

147
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:58,299
Rue, I don't give a shit.

148
00:10:58,301 --> 00:11:00,720
- Why'd you call me?
- Honestly...

149
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,141
I didn't really have
anybody else to call.

150
00:11:08,561 --> 00:11:11,022
Well, what happened
to make you call?

151
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,692
Um...

152
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:21,782
you know...

153
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:27,536
just like...

154
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:30,875
Open the fucking door!
Fuck!

155
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:35,002
...just the usual bullshit.

156
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:38,758
Rue, you know that drug addicts
don't reach out for help

157
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:41,552
unless there's no options.

158
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:44,138
So what happened?

159
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:50,561
Um...

160
00:11:51,646 --> 00:11:53,604
I was with my best friend.

161
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:55,940
Okay, well, she's...
I mean, she's a new friend,

162
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:57,985
but we hang out every day.

163
00:11:58,611 --> 00:12:00,071
And, um...

164
00:12:01,906 --> 00:12:05,074
It's stupid.
It's stupid.

165
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:06,953
- What?
- I just...

166
00:12:09,288 --> 00:12:13,417
I misread...
the whole situation.

167
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:18,045
And now it's gonna be
really, really, really...

168
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,381
really fucking awkward.

169
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:23,467
And I guess that

170
00:12:23,469 --> 00:12:26,595
hanging out with her was...

171
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:30,559
was the best thing that's
happened to me in a while, so...

172
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:36,065
Does the way in which you feel
about her remind you of anything?

173
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:42,611
- What do you mean?
- You know, like... the obsession,

174
00:12:42,613 --> 00:12:45,741
the feelings, the withdrawal.

175
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,328
What, like drugs?

176
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:52,579
Bingo.

177
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:55,209
Okay, but this is a good thing.

178
00:12:56,127 --> 00:13:00,339
Didn't drugs feel real good
the first time you tried 'em?

179
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:12,893
Shit.

180
00:13:26,157 --> 00:13:29,033
Yeah. It's gon' be
a good night, tonight, man.

181
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:30,494
Let's get this money.

182
00:13:41,547 --> 00:13:43,255
What's good, bro?

183
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:45,049
Fuck.

184
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:46,675
- You wanna go on the Gravitron?
- Uh, no.

185
00:13:46,677 --> 00:13:48,218
- The Ferris wheel?
- Nope.

186
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,179
- Why?
- Because I don't wanna die.

187
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:53,891
Where are you? I'm standing
by the fucking Ferris wheel.

188
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:56,310
I don't see you.

189
00:13:56,312 --> 00:14:02,441
Why do you always do this to me?

190
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:05,402
- Whoa! Whoa! Aah!
- We're gonna die, die!

191
00:14:05,404 --> 00:14:08,697
Oh, my God.

192
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:11,617
Stop! Stop!

193
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:14,203
Stop! You're rocking
the fucking thing.

194
00:14:14,205 --> 00:14:16,499
- You're rocking...
- Oh, my God.

195
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:21,585
Yo, are you at this Ferris
wheel or that Ferris wheel?

196
00:14:21,587 --> 00:14:23,754
Well, how the fuck am I supposed
to know which one you're at?

197
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:25,464
You don't fucking tell me...

198
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:27,174
Yeah, I know, I know.
I'm on my way. I...

199
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:29,679
How am I supposed to know that
there's two Ferris wheels?

200
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,182
- Yo, why are dressed like a hooker?
- What?

201
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:37,685
Jesus Christ, Maddy.
I'm here with my parents.

202
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:40,062
- So what? It's the carnival.
- No. It's the chili cook-off.

203
00:14:40,064 --> 00:14:41,605
It's very important. I can't have you

204
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:43,148
hanging out at the booth
dressed like that.

205
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,775
Yeah, well maybe it'll sell better.

206
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:47,194
Yo, this isn't a fucking joke, okay?

207
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:48,821
Why are you being like this?

208
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:51,615
Listen, my parents
already don't like you.

209
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:52,994
What?

210
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:56,245
Go home, get changed,

211
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:59,125
and come back looking like a person.
Fuck.

212
00:15:06,424 --> 00:15:08,382
- Well, did you break up again?
- No.

213
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:10,342
- Looks like you broke up again.
- No, we didn't.

214
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:13,014
If you ask me, she's a distraction.

215
00:15:15,558 --> 00:15:17,683
Hurry up, guy, go!

216
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:20,438
- Oh!
- Ew!

217
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:27,320
Hold on.

218
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:30,448
Oh, my God.
Jules!

219
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:32,992
Come!

220
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:38,623
Hands and feet inside the ride
unless you want to die.

221
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,920
- Hey.
- Hey.

222
00:15:46,922 --> 00:15:49,050
I'm really fucking scared.

223
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:53,220
Oh, no!

224
00:16:32,385 --> 00:16:34,218
- Hi.
- Hey.

225
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,389
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

226
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:42,559
Um, I think she's in love with her.

227
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:44,436
Really?

228
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:48,023
Yeah, like... Rue is in
love with Jules, I think.

229
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:51,195
- Are you mad at me?
- No. No, no.

230
00:16:52,863 --> 00:16:54,947
Are you mad at me?

231
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:57,032
- No.
- Okay.

232
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:59,201
Don't you think?

233
00:16:59,203 --> 00:17:01,370
I hadn't really thought about it.

234
00:17:01,372 --> 00:17:04,331
Oh. I don't know.

235
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,126
Can we just pretend like
what I did wasn't super-weird?

236
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:10,337
- It wasn't weird. It...
- It was weird, but...

237
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,383
we don't have to talk about it.

238
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:15,926
Talk about what?

239
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:18,637
- Nothing.
- Right.

240
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:22,558
Okay, um... Anyway, I'm gonna
go catch some friends.

241
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,061
- All right.
- Okay.

242
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:37,156
- Uh-oh. Mr. Jacobs.
- Oh!

243
00:17:37,158 --> 00:17:38,949
- Stingray McKay.
- I see you...

244
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:40,743
- I see what you got going on over here.
- All right, chili.

245
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:42,286
Let me get some.

246
00:17:42,288 --> 00:17:44,496
- Yo, what's up, brother?
- How you doin', man?

247
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,000
Yo.

248
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:50,336
What are you... Are you guys,
like, in a relationship?

249
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:52,921
- Nah, we're just chillin'.
- Are you just chillin'?

250
00:17:52,923 --> 00:17:55,507
Yeah, we're chillin'.

251
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:57,843
Okay. Okay.

252
00:17:57,845 --> 00:18:00,220
Why haven't I seen you on the field?

253
00:18:00,222 --> 00:18:04,391
Uh.... Just freshmen got to earn
their due, that's all.

254
00:18:04,393 --> 00:18:07,647
You take that attitude, you'll spend
the rest of your life on the bench.

255
00:18:09,315 --> 00:18:12,358
It's really not that big of a deal, Mr.
Jacobs. It's just the first season.

256
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,984
No, it is a big deal.

257
00:18:13,986 --> 00:18:16,487
You got one of the best
slide-steps I've ever seen.

258
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:18,238
You've got promise.
You've got talent.

259
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,990
You're not pushing yourself
hard enough.

260
00:18:19,992 --> 00:18:22,326
Dad, I think McKay's
gonna be just fine.

261
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:25,414
I'm just trying to help him
keep a girl like her.

262
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,084
Why? It's not like
we're in a relationship.

263
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:32,797
- Plus, I don't even care about football.
- Whoa.

264
00:18:34,131 --> 00:18:37,675
It's not just football.
It's life.

265
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:40,469
It's about maintaining your focus.

266
00:18:40,471 --> 00:18:43,973
It's about putting your all
into everything you do.

267
00:18:43,975 --> 00:18:46,600
Why do you think I have
the business I have?

268
00:18:46,602 --> 00:18:48,769
Why do think I have
the family I have?

269
00:18:48,771 --> 00:18:50,896
The success that I have?

270
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:53,107
Why do think this chili

271
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:56,568
has been voted best chili in the
county five years in a row?

272
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,197
'Cause you refuse to lose.

273
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:04,662
It's about who you want
to become in the world.

274
00:19:05,538 --> 00:19:07,540
I'm just lookin' out for you.

275
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:12,293
- Bye.
- Cassie.

276
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:15,214
- What the fuck is her problem?
- Come on, bro.

277
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,222
Yo, Cass. Cass.

278
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:25,597
Cass, stop.

279
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,683
Why would you say that?

280
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:29,602
That we're just chillin'?

281
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:31,645
It's not that big of a deal,
Cass. It's a figure of speech.

282
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:33,564
- It is a big deal.
- It's really not.

283
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:35,566
You literally just told me
that you loved me.

284
00:19:35,568 --> 00:19:37,359
What does that have
to do with anything?

285
00:19:37,361 --> 00:19:40,404
You just told Nate that we're not
even in a fucking relationship.

286
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:43,115
That's because I know the guy.
He's just gonna talk shit.

287
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:46,035
- Like what?
- Like about you.

288
00:19:46,037 --> 00:19:47,870
Or whatever, Cassie.

289
00:19:47,872 --> 00:19:49,957
What do you mean, whatever?

290
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,710
Like whatever the fuck you've done.

291
00:19:54,587 --> 00:19:56,505
What have I done, McKay?

292
00:19:57,757 --> 00:20:00,049
Look, I don't want to talk
about this right now, Cass.

293
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:01,634
We're in the middle
of a fucking carnival.

294
00:20:01,636 --> 00:20:03,471
I don't know what
you're talking about.

295
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:11,771
It's not like it's that big
of a fucking secret, Cassie.

296
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:18,025
You know what?
It's cool.

297
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:21,614
We should just call it a night.
I gotta get back, anyway.

298
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:38,629
- So, what you was lookin' for?
- Molly.

299
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:41,300
Oh. She over there workin'
at the pretzel stand.

300
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:43,469
Thank you.

301
00:20:51,811 --> 00:20:53,312
Hey.

302
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:56,188
- Hey.
- You're not having fun?

303
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,234
- No.
- Yeah, me, neither.

304
00:20:59,277 --> 00:21:01,028
You wanna do Molly?

305
00:21:02,405 --> 00:21:05,948
Welcome to Pretzelmania.
Can I take your order?

306
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,075
How many pretzels do you want?

307
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:10,869
- We don't eat carbs.
- Two, please.

308
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:12,748
That'll be forty.

309
00:21:17,628 --> 00:21:19,755
So, you think Nate's
cheating on you?

310
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:23,759
I don't know. He's just been
acting super-weird lately.

311
00:21:28,514 --> 00:21:30,599
Have you gone through his phone?

312
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:34,727
I've never not gone through
someone's phone.

313
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:36,897
Bitch, you're my soul mate.

314
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:41,527
Thank you.

315
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:45,654
Yo, what's going
on with you and McKay?

316
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:47,239
I thought you two were in love.

317
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:49,617
Nate asked McKay
if were were in a relationship,

318
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:51,744
and McKay said that
we were just chillin'.

319
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:53,537
- What?
- Yeah.

320
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:56,665
Honestly, fuck them both.

321
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:58,334
Right?

322
00:21:58,336 --> 00:22:00,461
Okay, so if I
tell you something,

323
00:22:00,463 --> 00:22:02,921
you swear on your fucking life
you won't say a word?

324
00:22:02,923 --> 00:22:04,467
Yeah. What?

325
00:22:05,968 --> 00:22:07,762
I went through Nate's phone.

326
00:22:08,804 --> 00:22:10,598
And it was weird.

327
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:23,525
- Oh, my fucking God.
- What?

328
00:22:23,527 --> 00:22:25,069
- That's him.
- Who?

329
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:26,779
The guy.

330
00:22:26,781 --> 00:22:29,823
- What guy?
- The one from the motel.

331
00:22:29,825 --> 00:22:31,408
Okay, what guy are
we looking at, exactly?

332
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,119
Okay, the one in the apron,
serving the chili.

333
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:35,704
- I swear to God.
- No fucking way.

334
00:22:35,706 --> 00:22:37,247
Jules, do you know who that is?

335
00:22:37,249 --> 00:22:39,750
- Yeah, the guy from the motel.
- That's Cal Jacobs.

336
00:22:39,752 --> 00:22:41,752
- Who's that?
- Nate Jacobs's dad.

337
00:22:41,754 --> 00:22:44,755
- That's Nate's dad?
- Yes, that's Nate's dad.

338
00:22:44,757 --> 00:22:46,924
- No fucking way!
- Yes, fucking way.

339
00:22:46,926 --> 00:22:48,884
- You're full of shit.
- No way.

340
00:22:48,886 --> 00:22:50,262
You're full of shit.

341
00:22:51,055 --> 00:22:52,888
Do you... Do you know who he is?

342
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,099
He fucking owns half this town.
He built it.

343
00:22:55,101 --> 00:22:57,059
All the apartment buildings
past Kemper, they're his.

344
00:22:57,061 --> 00:22:58,686
- Rue, I swear to God.
- There's no way.

345
00:22:58,688 --> 00:23:00,312
- That's the guy I fucked.
- There's no way.

346
00:23:00,314 --> 00:23:01,897
Bullshit.

347
00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:04,149
I'm being a hundred percent serious.

348
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:07,361
- You... You don't believe me?
- No, actually.

349
00:23:07,363 --> 00:23:09,657
- I don't.
- Okay. Watch.

350
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:22,420
- Excuse me, sir.
- Hmm?

351
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:27,381
Hi. Can I help you?

352
00:23:27,383 --> 00:23:29,802
Uh, can I please have
a small cup of chili?

353
00:23:31,053 --> 00:23:32,430
Yeah, sure.

354
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:52,325
Oh.

355
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:54,575
Shoot.

356
00:23:54,577 --> 00:23:56,203
Sorry.

357
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:04,043
Uh, it... it's okay.
It was my fault.

358
00:24:04,045 --> 00:24:05,671
I'll get you another cup.

359
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,549
Hi. It's two dollars. All the
proceeds go to the football team.

360
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:13,010
Uh... cool.

361
00:24:13,012 --> 00:24:14,388
Thank you.

362
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:25,524
Thanks.

363
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:32,446
Yo, Nate, who was that?

364
00:24:32,448 --> 00:24:35,449
Her name's Jules.
She's new here.

365
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:37,036
She goes to East Highland?

366
00:24:38,454 --> 00:24:40,537
Yeah. She's a junior.

367
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:42,206
Damn. That's jailbait.

368
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:44,377
That's too bad.

369
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:50,255
- ...nuts!
- Why the fuck did you let me do that?

370
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:52,216
I didn't let you do that!
You just fucking...

371
00:24:52,218 --> 00:24:55,427
You just did it. You went over
there and you did it.

372
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:57,346
Did you see that
his hands were fucking shaking?

373
00:24:57,348 --> 00:24:59,556
- Yes, and then he dropped...
- And then he fucking dropped the chili!

374
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:01,392
- Oh, my God.
- He dropped the fucking chili.

375
00:25:01,394 --> 00:25:03,852
Oh, he dropped the fucking chili.
And then he...

376
00:25:03,854 --> 00:25:05,396
And then you looked at me.

377
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:07,648
Yeah, because
I was screaming inside.

378
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,234
Yeah, well, that made him
fucking look at me.

379
00:25:10,236 --> 00:25:12,069
- He looked at me in the fucking eyes.
- I'm sorry.

380
00:25:12,071 --> 00:25:14,280
I feel so bad. That was
literally the meanest thing

381
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:16,198
- I've ever done.
- Oh, shit, hold on. It's my mom.

382
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,868
Hey, Mom.

383
00:25:19,537 --> 00:25:21,453
Yeah. Yeah, no.

384
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:24,959
Well, because she's been in the
Gravitron for like 20 straight minutes.

385
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:29,338
Yes, yes. I promise.
We will be home by ten.

386
00:25:30,214 --> 00:25:32,091
Okay, I love you, too.

387
00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:35,553
Apparently, Gia's
not answering her phone.

388
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:38,889
- Uh...
- It's just going straight to voicemail.

389
00:25:45,354 --> 00:25:46,939
It burns.

390
00:25:49,442 --> 00:25:52,109
It's so weird
to think that, like,

391
00:25:52,111 --> 00:25:54,528
no matter what happens,

392
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,826
the universe is just out here
giving, like, zero fucks.

393
00:26:00,202 --> 00:26:01,579
Wow.

394
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:07,333
- You look super cute.
- Thanks. You, too. I love that shirt.

395
00:26:07,335 --> 00:26:10,210
Thank you. Even though I
have the same body as Bruno Mars.

396
00:26:10,212 --> 00:26:12,046
- Shut up, you look hot.
- No, I don't.

397
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:13,631
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't,

398
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:15,549
'cause
these right here, they're cutlets.

399
00:26:15,551 --> 00:26:18,510
No, they're not. Trust me,
these guys are super chill, okay?

400
00:26:18,512 --> 00:26:20,137
Do not worry.

401
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:22,181
- Your mom's, like, all organic, right?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

402
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:25,476
- There's your issue.
- What do you mean?

403
00:26:25,478 --> 00:26:28,354
Uh, organic food doesn't
have any good hormones.

404
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:31,357
You gotta get her to buy, like,
the regular stuff, okay?

405
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:33,067
What's the regular stuff?

406
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:35,861
- Trust me. Oh, and milk, and milk.
- No! I hate milk!

407
00:26:35,863 --> 00:26:38,155
At least three glasses a day.
Three glasses.

408
00:26:38,157 --> 00:26:40,532
That's how I went
from a small A to a full B.

409
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:42,076
Mm-hmm.

410
00:26:42,078 --> 00:26:44,078
- Fine, I'll try it.
- I'm telling you.

411
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,413
- You gotta do it.
- How old are the boys again?

412
00:26:46,415 --> 00:26:47,792
They're, like, our age.
Yeah.

413
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:50,292
That's a lot.

414
00:26:50,294 --> 00:26:52,294
- I know.
- They are so good.

415
00:26:52,296 --> 00:26:53,837
- Right?
- I could drink these, like,

416
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,464
- every day of my life.
- Yes.

417
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:58,550
Uh, how 'bout you grab
another slushie,

418
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:02,805
I go get more tickets, and then get
super drunk and ride the Ferris wheel?

419
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:04,473
Deal.

420
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:06,141
- Okay.
- Okay. All right.

421
00:27:06,143 --> 00:27:07,520
All right.

422
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:12,191
- Thank you.
- No problem.

423
00:27:31,794 --> 00:27:33,419
Just tell your sister
I really need her

424
00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:35,713
- to cover my shift on Wednesday.
- Okay.

425
00:27:35,715 --> 00:27:38,299
For real. She's not
answering any of my texts.

426
00:27:38,301 --> 00:27:40,467
I promise you I will say something.

427
00:27:40,469 --> 00:27:43,095
I'm supposed to meet my
boyfriend's family for the first time.

428
00:27:43,097 --> 00:27:44,680
It's really important.

429
00:27:44,682 --> 00:27:46,432
Yeah, I got you.

430
00:27:46,434 --> 00:27:48,436
Thank you.
You're the best.

431
00:28:00,364 --> 00:28:03,574
- Honestly, fuck that whole family.
- For real.

432
00:28:03,576 --> 00:28:06,285
'Cause right now I'm looking at
a thousand versions of myself,

433
00:28:06,287 --> 00:28:09,663
and not only do I look good,
I fucking feel good.

434
00:28:09,665 --> 00:28:11,665
- It's a bitch.
- So, if they've got something to say,

435
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:13,709
they should just say it
to my face, right?

436
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:15,753
Or you could just say it
to their fucking face.

437
00:28:15,755 --> 00:28:18,922
- Right?
- That's what I would do.

438
00:28:18,924 --> 00:28:22,593
- I feel like this is a turning point.
- Totally.

439
00:28:22,595 --> 00:28:25,971
We should just pick the hottest,

440
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:30,059
most confident,
bad bitch version of ourselves,

441
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:33,145
and be that for the rest
of the school year.

442
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:35,648
Yo.

443
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,442
And this year's winner
of the chili cook-off is...

444
00:28:38,444 --> 00:28:40,446
Cal Jacobs!

445
00:28:41,781 --> 00:28:44,408
Make it six years and running!

446
00:29:01,926 --> 00:29:03,467
Yeah, I'm not supposed
to be here right now,

447
00:29:03,469 --> 00:29:05,135
because I'm dressed like a hooker,

448
00:29:05,137 --> 00:29:06,971
and none of you like me,

449
00:29:06,973 --> 00:29:08,764
but I just wanted to say
congratulations.

450
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:10,349
Maddy, get out of...

451
00:29:10,351 --> 00:29:12,726
Ooh!

452
00:29:12,728 --> 00:29:14,520
What in God's name is your problem?

453
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:16,565
You, cunt.

454
00:29:25,283 --> 00:29:27,994
- Hey.
- 'Sup, Cass?

455
00:29:29,745 --> 00:29:32,204
You wanna ride the carousel?

456
00:29:32,206 --> 00:29:34,123
Cool.

457
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:37,001
Shit.
She's not answering.

458
00:29:37,003 --> 00:29:40,129
- It's just going straight to voicemail.
- I mean, she can't be too far.

459
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:42,506
Well, I have to get her home
in like, 30 minutes.

460
00:29:42,508 --> 00:29:45,301
- Gia!
- Gia!

461
00:29:45,303 --> 00:29:46,929
Excuse me. Sorry.

462
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:49,807
Gia!

463
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,312
- Gia!
- Gia!

464
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,149
Fuck. Okay. Uh...

465
00:30:00,151 --> 00:30:01,900
It'd be faster if we split up.

466
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:04,488
- Yeah. Okay. Text me. Thank you.
- Okay.

467
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,698
I'm not
gonna let you fucking embarrass me

468
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,660
like that again,
I swear to fucking God.

469
00:30:10,786 --> 00:30:12,870
Shut the fuck up!
I'm fucking done with you!

470
00:30:12,872 --> 00:30:14,496
- I'm so fucking done with you.
- So what else is new?

471
00:30:14,498 --> 00:30:16,081
- I'm not fucking joking.
- Yeah, fucking right.

472
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,334
Calling my mom a cunt.
What the fuck is actually wrong

473
00:30:18,336 --> 00:30:20,379
- with your fucking brain?
- I think you're overreacting.

474
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:26,675
You're fucking dead to me.

475
00:30:26,677 --> 00:30:28,137
Fuck you.

476
00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:32,975
- I do have one question, though.
- Yo, what?

477
00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:40,856
Man, I'm telling you, that
girl has some real, fucking issues.

478
00:30:40,858 --> 00:30:42,902
I have to use the bathroom.

479
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:46,072
Gia!

480
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:49,909
Gia!

481
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,787
Gia!

482
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:28,698
Got an extra cigarette?

483
00:32:01,272 --> 00:32:03,399
Damn, you're so fucking hot.

484
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:08,070
I could ride the carousel for hours!

485
00:32:11,574 --> 00:32:13,991
- Emma. Yo.
- Yo, Rue. What up?

486
00:32:13,993 --> 00:32:17,536
- Have you seen Gia?
- Yeah, like, over there.

487
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:20,623
- Over where? Where is she?
- You know. Like, the Gravitron.

488
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:23,542
- Is she in the Gravitron?
- No, she's like, by it.

489
00:32:23,544 --> 00:32:25,880
I... I really have to pee.

490
00:32:35,514 --> 00:32:37,058
Gia!

491
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:48,108
Gia!

492
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,652
Gia!

493
00:32:49,654 --> 00:32:52,154
Aren't you Luke Kasten?

494
00:32:52,156 --> 00:32:53,697
Yeah.

495
00:32:53,699 --> 00:32:55,991
You used to go
to East Highland, right?

496
00:32:55,993 --> 00:32:58,829
Yeah, like, fuckin' forever ago.

497
00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:03,624
I used to hear stories about you,
like, all the time in middle school.

498
00:33:03,626 --> 00:33:05,628
Oh, yeah?
What kind of stories?

499
00:33:08,506 --> 00:33:10,255
That you had a...

500
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:12,927
have a really big dick and
fucked every girl in your grade.

501
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:17,056
Basically.

502
00:33:17,848 --> 00:33:19,558
That's cool.

503
00:33:21,894 --> 00:33:23,688
How old are you?

504
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:28,359
Sixteen.

505
00:33:59,056 --> 00:34:02,057
I'm just saying, as your girlfriend,
those pictures are a little suspicious.

506
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:03,601
It's not what it looks like.

507
00:34:03,603 --> 00:34:05,311
Yeah? Well, then, explain
to me why you have

508
00:34:05,313 --> 00:34:07,896
someone else's dick in your phone.

509
00:34:07,898 --> 00:34:09,857
It's really fucking complicated.

510
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:12,484
How many reasons could there be?

511
00:34:12,486 --> 00:34:14,528
I can't explain it to you right now.

512
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,655
Yeah, what does that mean?

513
00:34:16,657 --> 00:34:19,535
Look, I'm going through
a lot of shit right now.

514
00:34:21,662 --> 00:34:23,954
I need... I just...
I need you to promise me

515
00:34:23,956 --> 00:34:25,664
that you're not gonna tell a soul.

516
00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:27,666
I am not gonna
tell anyone, I promise.

517
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:30,336
- Like, on your life.
- Yeah, on my life.

518
00:34:30,338 --> 00:34:33,382
I'm sorry I got so angry
at you before.

519
00:34:34,884 --> 00:34:36,594
I am sorry.

520
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,642
I'm sorry.

521
00:34:46,771 --> 00:34:48,356
I love you.

522
00:34:49,565 --> 00:34:50,983
Maddy, I love you.

523
00:34:53,486 --> 00:34:55,235
I got a lot of sh...

524
00:34:55,237 --> 00:34:57,823
a lot of shit going on right
now and I'm really confused.

525
00:34:58,574 --> 00:35:00,451
I don't know what to do.

526
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:24,869
Ho, ho, ho. Nasty!

527
00:36:52,355 --> 00:36:53,856
Gia!

528
00:36:56,067 --> 00:36:58,567
What the hell?
I've been calling you.

529
00:36:58,569 --> 00:37:00,196
Rue.

530
00:37:02,615 --> 00:37:05,534
- Are you stoned right now?
- Nah. Um-mm.

531
00:37:08,996 --> 00:37:10,996
- We're just chillin'.
- Yeah, that's my sister.

532
00:37:10,998 --> 00:37:12,581
- Yo, Roy.
- What's up?

533
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,416
This is Rue's little sis.

534
00:37:14,418 --> 00:37:17,920
Oh, yeah. I knew that by the
way she was hittin' the weed.

535
00:37:17,922 --> 00:37:19,546
That's me.

536
00:37:19,548 --> 00:37:21,298
All right, Gia, get up.
Let's go.

537
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,969
What do you mean, let's go?
You see we're having a funky good time.

538
00:37:24,971 --> 00:37:27,554
- That's great.
- I'm having the best time.

539
00:37:27,556 --> 00:37:30,015
- We need to go, now.
- We having the best time.

540
00:37:30,017 --> 00:37:31,684
Gia, get the fuck up and let's go.

541
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:33,227
- I'm not playing with you.
- Wow.

542
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:35,437
What'd you do?
Decide to just clean up,

543
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:37,731
- and, like, oh, I wanna become a mom?
- Right?

544
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:41,568
- Gia, get the fuck up. Let's go. Now.
- Mom. What's your problem, Mom?

545
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:44,907
Hey, if she's a mom,
you know she a MILF.

546
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:48,492
Get up.

547
00:37:48,494 --> 00:37:50,997
Yo, for real. When'd you
become such a bitch?

548
00:37:55,334 --> 00:37:57,126
Excuse me?

549
00:37:57,128 --> 00:37:59,463
Was it after you fuckin' OD'd?

550
00:38:01,966 --> 00:38:05,592
Yeah. It's good.
I know it's only weed,

551
00:38:05,594 --> 00:38:07,763
but you might get addicted.

552
00:38:10,016 --> 00:38:11,557
Get up.

553
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:14,145
Just hope you don't
get addicted again.

554
00:38:15,896 --> 00:38:17,813
All I'm saying is, if I were you,

555
00:38:17,815 --> 00:38:20,151
I wouldn't be taking
advice from her.

556
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:24,155
Yo. Text me.

557
00:38:25,197 --> 00:38:27,489
Don't do that
shit again, all right?

558
00:38:27,491 --> 00:38:29,535
You fucking scared me.

559
00:38:41,756 --> 00:38:43,215
Hey.

560
00:38:47,136 --> 00:38:50,596
Look, I know you have the power
to ruin my life right now.

561
00:38:50,598 --> 00:38:53,057
I'm begging you,

562
00:38:53,059 --> 00:38:55,559
pleading with you,

563
00:38:55,561 --> 00:38:57,063
please don't.

564
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:01,607
I know you already told your friend.
I saw her look at me.

565
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:04,193
She won't tell anyone.

566
00:39:04,195 --> 00:39:07,029
- I promise.
- 'Cause if this ever came out,

567
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:09,992
I'd lose everything.
I'd lose everything.

568
00:39:12,828 --> 00:39:14,997
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

569
00:39:20,336 --> 00:39:25,216
I have no intention of, like,
hurting you or anything.

570
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:30,680
I'm sorry about earlier.

571
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:33,766
That was kind of dumb.

572
00:39:36,352 --> 00:39:37,812
That's okay.

573
00:39:39,981 --> 00:39:41,399
I just wanted to...

574
00:39:42,316 --> 00:39:43,901
It won't be a thing.

575
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,405
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

576
00:39:49,115 --> 00:39:50,700
Thank you so much.

577
00:40:26,235 --> 00:40:28,235
Where were you?

578
00:40:28,237 --> 00:40:30,988
- What's wrong?
- I just think the Molly's, like,

579
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,743
way too strong or something.

580
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:46,045
So... did you come?

581
00:40:46,047 --> 00:40:47,465
No.

582
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,267
Uh, do you think Mom's gonna be

583
00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:02,436
sitting in the living room
when we get there?

584
00:41:02,438 --> 00:41:04,607
- No, she won't.
- Okay.

585
00:41:06,108 --> 00:41:08,110
Because, if, um...

586
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,946
If I walked in there,
I wouldn't know what to say.

587
00:41:11,948 --> 00:41:15,407
- I wouldn't say hi.
- No, she's... She's gonna be in her bed.

588
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:18,202
Trust me. Look, I need you,
when we get home,

589
00:41:18,204 --> 00:41:20,913
to just go straight to your room
and hide under the covers. Okay?

590
00:41:20,915 --> 00:41:23,165
Just let me deal with her.

591
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:25,834
Wh-what are you gonna tell her?

592
00:41:25,836 --> 00:41:28,005
I don't know yet.

593
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,635
What are you laughing at?

594
00:41:34,261 --> 00:41:35,846
You good?

595
00:41:37,723 --> 00:41:39,558
Come here.

596
00:41:46,899 --> 00:41:50,818
She's still a little sick from
riding the Gravitron so many times.

597
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,864
- Should I check on her?
- Oh, no. It's good. I got it.

598
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,536
Thank you for looking out
for her tonight.

599
00:42:00,162 --> 00:42:02,204
- Of course.
- Love you.

600
00:42:02,206 --> 00:42:05,710
- Love you, too. Good night, Mom.
- Good night.

601
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:23,955
Hey. Shut the door.

602
00:45:04,722 --> 00:45:06,098
Hey.

603
00:45:08,184 --> 00:45:09,560
Tyler?

604
00:45:27,787 --> 00:45:29,370
No. No!

605
00:45:29,372 --> 00:45:31,497
No, I'm not trying
to hurt you. I'm not.

606
00:45:31,499 --> 00:45:33,707
I'm not here to hurt you.

607
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:36,460
I know that you have
these ideas about me,

608
00:45:36,462 --> 00:45:38,673
based on the first time that
we met, and I understand that.

609
00:45:40,091 --> 00:45:42,176
But I'm not the person
that you met that night.

610
00:45:43,135 --> 00:45:44,512
Can you let go of me?

611
00:46:02,113 --> 00:46:04,282
You know, over the past few weeks...

612
00:46:06,117 --> 00:46:07,660
I've spent...

613
00:46:08,911 --> 00:46:11,747
every moment of every day
getting to know you.

614
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:15,876
At night...

615
00:46:16,669 --> 00:46:18,296
I fall asleep to you.

616
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,882
And in the morning...

617
00:46:22,717 --> 00:46:24,093
I wake up to you.

618
00:46:27,054 --> 00:46:31,475
I kind of feel closer to you than I
do to anyone in the whole world.

619
00:46:36,022 --> 00:46:37,982
I don't trust you, Nate.

620
00:46:42,737 --> 00:46:44,655
I don't trust you, either.

621
00:47:13,434 --> 00:47:16,226
- Open your mouth.
- Nate...

622
00:47:16,228 --> 00:47:17,647
Wider.

623
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:23,319
Nate. Nate, stop.

624
00:47:25,613 --> 00:47:28,115
God, are you broken inside.

625
00:47:29,575 --> 00:47:31,994
And that's precisely why
I don't trust you.

626
00:47:35,957 --> 00:47:39,126
Because you're so broken
you don't even trust yourself.

627
00:47:41,337 --> 00:47:43,381
And that's scary.

628
00:47:44,465 --> 00:47:48,175
Not just for you, but for me.

629
00:47:48,177 --> 00:47:50,596
And for my entire family.

630
00:47:53,307 --> 00:47:56,517
I wouldn't answer that.
You're gonna wanna hear this.

631
00:47:56,519 --> 00:47:59,895
Over the last three weeks,

632
00:47:59,897 --> 00:48:04,149
you have knowingly produced and
distributed child pornography.

633
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:07,569
Including obscene images that
were taken on school property.

634
00:48:07,571 --> 00:48:10,489
I've compiled all these photos,

635
00:48:10,491 --> 00:48:14,662
along with an IP address, and an
account that's linked to your name.

636
00:48:16,914 --> 00:48:20,459
I don't know if you're familiar with
child pornography laws in this state.

637
00:48:22,169 --> 00:48:25,589
But they apply to minors
just as they apply to adults.

638
00:48:26,924 --> 00:48:29,008
I sent them to you.

639
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:31,302
No. You sent them

640
00:48:31,304 --> 00:48:34,223
to an account of a person
that doesn't fucking exist.

641
00:48:35,391 --> 00:48:39,228
And I mean, anyone can anonymously
report child pornography, right?

642
00:48:41,772 --> 00:48:44,523
- Then I'd tell them everything.
- Okay.

643
00:48:44,525 --> 00:48:47,901
You could do that, but, um...

644
00:48:47,903 --> 00:48:50,406
here's what would definitely happen.

645
00:48:52,658 --> 00:48:55,161
You'd end up on
a sex offenders list.

646
00:48:56,871 --> 00:48:58,873
It means no more college.

647
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:03,628
It's gonna be very fucking
difficult to find a job.

648
00:49:06,922 --> 00:49:09,131
And everywhere you go,

649
00:49:09,133 --> 00:49:11,800
for the rest of your life,

650
00:49:11,802 --> 00:49:14,303
you'll be harassed, and spat at,

651
00:49:14,305 --> 00:49:16,265
and treated like a fucking animal.

652
00:49:17,975 --> 00:49:21,812
You deserve better than that.
'Cause I know you.

653
00:49:23,856 --> 00:49:26,233
You're kind.

654
00:49:27,193 --> 00:49:30,110
You're smart.
You're generous.

655
00:49:30,112 --> 00:49:32,237
You got a big heart.

656
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:36,577
You deserve whatever the fuck it
is in this world that you want.

657
00:49:38,663 --> 00:49:40,412
So keep your head down.

658
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:42,375
Keep your mouth shut.

659
00:49:44,335 --> 00:49:47,169
Don't try to ruin my life,

660
00:49:47,171 --> 00:49:49,590
and I won't have to ruin yours.

661
00:49:52,718 --> 00:49:54,845
You know what I think?

662
00:49:56,681 --> 00:50:00,101
I think you're a fucking faggot,
just like your daddy.

663
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:14,282
You have a nice night.

664
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:05,080
- Hey.
- Hey.

665
00:51:05,082 --> 00:51:07,710
Do you think
I could, uh, sleep over?

666
00:51:08,586 --> 00:51:10,963
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Come on.

667
00:51:49,627 --> 00:51:51,253
Is everything okay?

668
00:51:58,386 --> 00:52:00,260
Um...

669
00:52:00,262 --> 00:52:02,014
Here.

670
00:52:04,058 --> 00:52:06,850
So how'd the date go with Tyler?

671
00:52:06,852 --> 00:52:08,562
Um...

672
00:52:18,114 --> 00:52:20,658
He didn't look like his picture.

673
00:52:39,093 --> 00:52:40,928
Come here.

674
00:53:03,284 --> 00:53:05,202
Are you sure you're okay?

675
00:54:11,102 --> 00:54:12,520
What?

676
00:54:15,856 --> 00:54:20,856
