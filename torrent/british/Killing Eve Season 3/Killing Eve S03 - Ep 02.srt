Oh...

00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:48,899
Bastard!

4
00:00:56,763 --> 00:00:58,442
You need to go electric.

5
00:00:58,443 --> 00:01:00,682
Great advice. Thanks.

6
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:02,603
I saw you talking to yourself earlier.

7
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,162
Excuse me?

8
00:01:05,163 --> 00:01:07,162
And you drink a lot.

9
00:01:07,163 --> 00:01:09,659
Okay, this might have
worked for you before,

10
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,041
but just so you know, it's failing.

11
00:01:11,043 --> 00:01:13,344
And for your information, I'm not drunk.

12
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:15,620
You will be by the end of the night.

13
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,630
It's pull, by the way.

14
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,559
No judgement on my part.

15
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,099
I'm just making an observation.

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,107
Well, go observe somewhere else.

17
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:30,667
Oh-ho-ho.

18
00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:33,019
Wow! Are you always this defensive?

19
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,100
Are you always this much of a dick?

20
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,707
I... I'm not... I'm not drunk.

21
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,259
He's just very...

22
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,599
... very annoying.

Vodka. Straight.

26
00:02:25,548 --> 00:02:27,030
And make it double.

27
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,229
Not because I'm Russian.

28
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,559
Because it works.

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,640
Kenny would be so touched.

30
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,899
What do you want?

31
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,199
Gin.

32
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,510
Gin, please.

33
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,899
I hear you are a walking miracle.

34
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,719
- Oh, hallelujah!
- Ha!

35
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,708
You know, when a bullet
has been through you,

36
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:51,360
it leaves something behind.

37
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,027
Poor Kenny.

38
00:02:56,028 --> 00:02:57,550
Oh, he'd hate this.

39
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,740
He chose it.

40
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,849
How do you know what he chose?

41
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,879
Jumping off a building

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,819
- is a very clear choice.
- Oh, bullshit. Don't say...

43
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,110
Why is everyone saying he jumped?!

44
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,640
Just be quiet.

45
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,019
You must think of the family.

46
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,779
Please, don't pretend... for one second,

47
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,510
that you ever think of
anyone but yourself.

48
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,279
- Oh...
- I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

49
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,999
Oh, you...

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,819
- Having a good night?
- Yeah, well, you know what?

51
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,359
You've really got this whole, um,
smug face thing down, don't you?

52
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,699
It's just my face.

53
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,879
Tune!

54
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,020
Yeah, he'd... he'd always play this

55
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,060
when he won the office table tennis.

56
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,659
Which wasn't very often, was it?

57
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,139
Excuse me? I'm sorry.

58
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:54,460
Um... did you... did you work
with Kenny at Bitter Pill?

59
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,999
Uh, yeah... yeah, that's right.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,079
- How was he? I was...
- Jamie Hayward,

61
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,879
founder, editor of Bitter Pill.

62
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,330
Now, if you have any queries
about Kenny's work...

63
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,839
- No, I...
- ... you can come to me.

64
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,550
I have no queries.

65
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,379
Excuse me.

66
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,960
Hmm.

67
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,140

topped up, please?

Do I have crisps in my beard?

It's you.

77
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,670
It's you!

78
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,079
It was one of Mum's dinners.

79
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,819
I was about eight, nine,

80
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,299
and I'd had a nightmare and you
found me crying on the stairs.

81
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,460
Hmm!

82
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,079
You told me you were
there as monster watch,

83
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,400
to make sure that nothing scary
would come into the house.

84
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,187
And... then you taught me
how to swear in Russian.

85
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:48,947
- I did?
- Mudak.

86
00:06:51,388 --> 00:06:53,507
- I did.
- Yeah.

87
00:06:53,508 --> 00:06:55,627
You haven't changed a bit.

88
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:57,147
You have!

89
00:06:57,148 --> 00:06:59,519
Geraldine, can you ask them
to change that music?

90
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,899
It's terribly dreary.

91
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,699
Today isn't about pretending
we're not sad, Mum.

92
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,359
It's about acknowledging
the sadness together.

93
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,590
Couldn't we be sad and
listen to good music?

94
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,499
- She staying long with you?
- No idea.

95
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,000
Apparently, she wants to help me grieve.

96
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,519
Do you need help?

97
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,239
Absolutely not.

98
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,579
Just excuse me.

99
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,867
Um, Eve...

100
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:35,307
I'm sorry for your loss.

101
00:07:35,308 --> 00:07:37,799
I left you several messages.

102
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,380
Oh...

103
00:07:39,388 --> 00:07:41,827
Eve, it's push, by the way. Can we talk?

104
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,399
Do you think he jumped?

105
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,030
Yes.

106
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,310
Hmm!

107
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,499
- Eve, I need you to...
- No.

108
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,399
- But, Eve, Eve...
- I said no! Do you hear me?

109
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,230
No! No!

110
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,239
No!

111
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,780
Bloody hell.

112
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,739
Just... didn't like the buffet.

113
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,510
Hmm.

114
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,479
You ask Dasha for the best,
Dasha gets you the best.

115
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,060
You're welcome.

116
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:33,987
Everything you asked for.

117
00:09:33,988 --> 00:09:36,459
Good light, high ceilings.

118
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,939
Chan, did you check the water pressure?

119
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,590
- Excellent.
- That was hard to get.

120
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,359
You know if you quit smoking,

121
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,719
you'd look, like, 10 years younger.

122
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,600
Why would I want to
look 10 years younger?

123
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,947
This neighbourhood is nice.

124
00:09:57,948 --> 00:09:59,722
You like what you see?

125
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:02,057
It's good to have many lovers.

126
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:03,523
It keeps you limber.

127
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,268
But you have to know, we are
different from these people.

128
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:10,699
Things they take for granted:

129
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,999
package holidays, car in drive,

130
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,519
date nights on sofa.

131
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,480
We can't have these things.

132
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,600
Winners win alone.

133
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,740
You can't go down that path anymore.

134
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,122
I dealt with it.

135
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:32,747
Ah. Hmm.

136
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:34,562
So, you don't think about her anymore?

137
00:10:34,563 --> 00:10:36,630
- I dealt with it!
- Mm-hm.

138
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,840
Okay.

139
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,919
So, the job went well, they're happy,

140
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,308
they're very happy with you.

141
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,160
And I appreciated the homage to Dasha.

142
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,042
I improved an untouchable relic.

143
00:10:48,043 --> 00:10:50,682
- Original's always best.
- Come on!

144
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,202
The paprika was kind of fun.

145
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:54,802
- I'd have gone turmeric, but...
- So, what do they do now?

146
00:10:54,803 --> 00:10:56,907
Do they send me a letter
of promotion or something?

147
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:59,482
They want you to work
with somebody first.

148
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:00,722
What are you talking about?

149
00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:03,562
You have to show them
that you're up to the job.

150
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,419
He's a new recruit.

151
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,479
You will be overseeing him.
You will be giving him orders.

152
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,039
If you want more control,

153
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,882
you have to show them
you have some judgement.

154
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:15,630
I know.

155
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,899
Carolyn? Carolyn...

156
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,890
Your blouse is, uh...

157
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,170
I like it like that.

158
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,610
Morning!

159
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,803
So...

160
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,319
Shall we just dive right in?

161
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,803
Maybe we should start with
the report on Agent...

162
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:54,799
Carolyn! We weren't... expecting...

163
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,239
Well, we certainly weren't
expecting you... so soon.

164
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,643
Why ever not?

165
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,159
Well...

166
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,100
How bloody gallant of you.

167
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,403
- Mina?
- Roger...

168
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,602
- Your FSB intelligence...
- Your Volgograd asset...

169
00:12:17,563 --> 00:12:20,283
- Are we looking at a honey trap...
- Regarding the Daesh Takfiri terror cell,

170
00:12:20,284 --> 00:12:22,239
are we talking about fully formed...

171
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,499
- What travel arrangements... ?
- ... high-level targets... ?

172
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,163
Let's all just...

173
00:12:25,164 --> 00:12:27,360
... take five.

174
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,240
It's too soon.

175
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:33,039
For what?

176
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,399
You're... on leave.

177
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,720
Surely, that's my decision.

178
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,079
I know returning to work
is a welcome distraction.

179
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,599
I don't believe in distractions.

180
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,760
I'm fully capable of doing my job,

181
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,220
without any approval from you.

182
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,239
I know you think I'm
a self-serving prick.

183
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,080
And... well, maybe I am.

184
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:04,179
But, Carolyn, your son has just died.

185
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,900
Some things are bigger than
the job, and this is one of them.

186
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,279
You have to start taking
care of yourself right now.

187
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,700
Or it's going to catch up with you.

188
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,842
- Your name?
- Jeffrey.

189
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:35,519
Can you give me the
status of the situation?

190
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,099
Why are you never the same person?

191
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,149
We work on rota.

192
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,239
It's like seeing a new
doctor every time.

193
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,882
I have to explain everything
from the beginning.

194
00:13:42,883 --> 00:13:45,522
Can you please look in
your notes or something?

195
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:48,039
Do you have my airline tickets?

196
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,919
They want you to stay
in London a bit longer.

197
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,359
Is that really necessary?

198
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,199
They need you to keep an eye on things.

199
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,122
That old MI6 friend of yours.

200
00:13:56,123 --> 00:13:58,739
- How long do I have to stay?
- No idea.

201
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,442
That's very useful. Thank you.

202
00:14:00,443 --> 00:14:02,642
Treat it as a working holiday.

203
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:04,363
Holiday, you need sunshine.

204
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,189
- _
- Mm.

205
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,680
_

206
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,610
Thirsty work, I imagine.

207
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,149
I worked on a farm.

208
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,963
My father arranged...

209
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,799
Both you and I know perfectly
well that... Kenny...

210
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,299
... didn't take his own life.

211
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,920
Yes.

212
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,859
But I have to be...

213
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,919
... discreet.

214
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,860
I can't... let people know
I'm looking into things.

215
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,159
You were potentially the last
person to speak to him properly

216
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,840
and it's imperative we talk.

217
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,679
Carolyn, I would do anything
for Kenny to be alive

218
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,082
and I am sorry you are
going through this, I am.

219
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,330
But I don't work for you anymore.

220
00:15:37,883 --> 00:15:40,010
Not after what you did in Rome.

221
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,683
I have something that I
think may interest you.

222
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,719
An agitator in Catalonia,
killed in her own shop.

223
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,519
No-one's claimed it.

224
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,840
She hasn't been active for months.

225
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,699
Not since Rome.

226
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,740
We actually thought she was dead.

227
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,920
She's back, Eve.

228
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,280
And she's working.

229
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:30,170
I can't help you.

230
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,690
I thought you'd want to know.

231
00:17:34,123 --> 00:17:36,919
So, who am I working with on this thing?

232
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,659
Felix Telep.

233
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,079
They say he has real potential.

234
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,719
And I just watch him
and give him a grade?

235
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,659
A: for excellent killing.
B: could do better.

236
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,799
- That kind of thing?
- You don't grade him.

237
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,279
You guide him.

238
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,079
Make sure his plan is clean,
his character work is strong.

239
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,940
You know, just like I
used to do with you.

240
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,519
- What if he's totally useless?
- Then encourage him.

241
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,559
You tell him he's great.

242
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,279
You tell him you know he can do it.

243
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,739
You make him believe he can be good.

244
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,719
Why can't I just do the
work and he watch?

245
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,762
- So much easier.
- Management is not easy.

246
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:14,099
It's watching someone
do job worse than you.

247
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,999
That's why it sucks.

248
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,160
But to be Keeper, that takes
patience and responsibility.

249
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,179
You need both.

250
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,962
I don't have both. I have neither.

251
00:18:24,963 --> 00:18:27,000
Then pretend that you have!

252
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,799
Come on, look around you, Villanelle.

253
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,359
They don't give places
like this to anybody.

254
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,739
Money, rewards, lifestyle,

255
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,820
it all gets better and better,
the more you succeed.

256
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,610
I believe in you.

257
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,603
So, it's that kind of thing.

258
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,682
Exactly.

259
00:18:55,683 --> 00:18:56,999
Hmm.

260
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,883
_

261
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,880
_

262
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,403
_

263
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,879
Hello? Eve?

264
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,119
Eve, if this is you, don't speak.

265
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,959
You've stolen a dead man's phone
with highly sensitive information,

266
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,039
a phone we're tracking right now.

267
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,599
We both know you've got the phone,

268
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,439
with no way for you to unlock it.

269
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,320
So, why don't you just stop dicking
around with this elusive crap?

270
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:27,483
Just bring it in and we can...

271
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,283
_

272
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,203
_

273
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,639
How did you know I had the phone?

274
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,699
Oh, that was bollocks.
We just guessed it was you.

275
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,709
What?!

276
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,719
Well, the police didn't
find Kenny's work phone.

277
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,479
You were the last person here.

278
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,170
It's pretty straightforward.

279
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,240
She's here.

280
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,323
Just give the phone to Bear.

281
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,923
I'm not giving it to anyone.
The phone stays with me.

282
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,522
Why'd you nick it?

283
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:23,962
I didn't nick anything. I just...
forgot to mention I found it.

284
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:25,562
What was Kenny working
on before he died?

285
00:21:25,563 --> 00:21:26,643
You tell me.

286
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,279
- I asked you.
- Why did you hire him?

287
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,719
MI6. Whiz online.

288
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,239
Integrity.

289
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,059
He was a triple threat.

290
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,039
You didn't want him to look
into anything specific?

291
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,599
I don't tell people what to investigate.

292
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,019
They work on what's important to them.

293
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,629
And Kenny didn't say
what is important to him?

294
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,643
What's important to you?

295
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,039
See, this isn't about me.

296
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,639
See, that's where I think you're wrong.

297
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,283
If it wasn't about you,
you wouldn't have the phone.

298
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,999
Look, two options here.

299
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,882
Either you keep it,

300
00:21:55,883 --> 00:21:57,479
with no way of cracking into it,

301
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,499
and Kenny's death grows
colder by the hour,

302
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,100
or you hand it over and we get going.

303
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,082
I want the files he was working on.

304
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,699
There's no way I'm handing
over classified information

305
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,800
without seeing that phone.

306
00:22:14,803 --> 00:22:17,402
Yeah, well, this phone isn't
free, so where's his laptop?

307
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,243
Every device is clean.
We don't store in the cloud.

308
00:22:19,244 --> 00:22:20,919
We work off encrypted thumb drives.

309
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,200
Fine!

310
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,803
As soon as we crack that phone.

311
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,860
Fine.

312
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,869
Le France.

313
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:46,029
_

314
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,730
I'm Felix.

315
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,930
What are you?

316
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,722
- 10?
- I'm 19.

317
00:23:06,723 --> 00:23:08,199
I'm tough.

318
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,202
- I have five older brothers.
- Wow!

319
00:23:10,203 --> 00:23:12,282
- Five big brothers?
- Yeah.

320
00:23:12,283 --> 00:23:14,402
And I beat the crap out of all of them.

321
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:16,643
Take off your hat.

322
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,119
Anybody can fight.

323
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,919
It takes a special person to kill.

324
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,562
I've killed, loads of times.

325
00:23:30,563 --> 00:23:32,122
- Bullshit!
- There was this kid

326
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:33,242
that bullied me in school.

327
00:23:33,243 --> 00:23:35,119
- Textbook. Basic.
- His sister.

328
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,609
- His father.
- I'm falling asleep here.

329
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,479
His cousin. Best friend, uncle,

330
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,123
dance teacher and grandma.

331
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,440
They were in the same car.

332
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:55,842
Just so you know, I'm kind of
a big deal in this industry.

333
00:23:55,843 --> 00:23:57,879
- Okay.
- You do everything I say,

334
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,899
- exactly when I say it.
- Okay.

335
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,520
If you make me look
bad, I will kill you.

336
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,879
- O... Okay.
- Okay.

337
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,380
Great talk. Good skills.

338
00:24:07,483 --> 00:24:09,520
Excellent work.

339
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:12,603
The travel is what I'm
most excited about.

340
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,919
I love hotels.

341
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,322
Well, make sure you ask for first-class.

342
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,319
None of this "submit
receipts after" bullshit.

343
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,160
They should pay up-front.

344
00:24:22,163 --> 00:24:24,300
Okay.

345
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,923
That kid bullied you bad, huh?

346
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,079
He beat up my boyfriend.

347
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,200
You did all that for a boyfriend?!

348
00:24:36,203 --> 00:24:38,359
Well, I was in love.

349
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,619
After everything I did,

350
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,200
he didn't want to know.

351
00:24:51,043 --> 00:24:54,959
When you love somebody and
they don't love you back,

352
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,260
it's... it's worse than...

353
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,299
I don't know what it's worse than,

354
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,789
- but it's really...
- Shit.

355
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,120
Yeah.

356
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,200
Shit.

357
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,100
- Sorry...
- Oh, it's okay.

358
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,159
Oh, hi.

359
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,899
Ah, it's you!

360
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,619
- Good to see you again!
- You too.

361
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,139
I'm sorry I didn't get to say
goodbye after the funeral.

362
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,629
Ah, that's okay.

363
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,999
There was just so much going
on, and I'm hyper-empathic,

364
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,219
so I get over-burdened with
other people's emotions,

365
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,360
which can be... a lot
to process, you know?

366
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,803
Staying in England long?

367
00:25:59,804 --> 00:26:01,940
Undecided.

368
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,719
I have some work I need to finish.

369
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,659
I was just sending this
to my daughter in Russia.

370
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,339
Oh, that's adorable.

371
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,219
I used to collect those
when I was a kid.

372
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,399
Ah.

373
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,539
She's too old for them, really.

374
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,479
Mum used to bring me and Kenny
small bottles of booze.

375
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,779
She says you only know a country
once you know its drink.

376
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,559
You should have this.

377
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,299
Oh, your daughter...

378
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,843
Oh, she wouldn't even notice.

379
00:26:29,844 --> 00:26:31,310
Please.

380
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,820
Thank you.

381
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,780
Oh, no...

382
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,739
I didn't want to upset you.

383
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,430
You haven't. It's just...

384
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,363
Moments of kindness
mean a lot right now.

385
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,739
Bonjour !

386
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,239
Papa! Papa! Papa!

387
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,239
No manners.

388
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,003
That's the target.

389
00:27:22,004 --> 00:27:23,563
_

390
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,159
Merci.

391
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,483
_

392
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,230
_

393
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,430
_

394
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,659
There he goes.

395
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,999
Stick to the plan.

396
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,799
- Okay.
- Behind the ear.

397
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,579
- Okay.
- Clean and clinical.

398
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,379
- Okay.
- Okay.

399
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,159
Okay, go. Now!

400
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,442
What happened to the plan?

401
00:28:59,443 --> 00:29:01,399
I improvised.

402
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,119
Oh?

403
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,360
Oh, management sucks.

404
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,999
This is everything
I could find right now.

405
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,243
The rest is gonna take more time.

406
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,949
Audrey.

407
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:28,540
- Who's Audrey?
- That's Audrey.

408
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,679
Did you know?

409
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,300
Yeah. He had started wearing deodorant.

410
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,219
It's good to know he was
getting some before he died.

411
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,639
What?!

412
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,019
It's good to know.

413
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,879
Uh, what else is on there?

414
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,479
The rest is gonna take a while.

415
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,739
He... he knew what he was doing.

416
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,400
- Well, how long is a while?
- A few days.

417
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,140
Okay. Well, then, uh,
give me his thumb drive.

418
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,850
The police have it.

419
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,639
Are you serious?!

420
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,683
- It was in his pocket.
- Oh!

421
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,999
Bastard.

422
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,799
Yeah. No, you're right.

423
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,560
This is never gonna be
solved without you, right?

424
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,779
Maybe we're just clinging to the idea
that something happened to him

425
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,379
because... we're too
afraid of the truth.

426
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,739
That he was just an unhappy kid,

427
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,400
and topped himself.

428
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,400
That's what you really
believe, isn't it?

429
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,920
Or why else would you be walking away?

430
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,730
Audrey?

431
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,699
Uh...

432
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,130
- Oh, hi...
- Hi.

433
00:31:13,883 --> 00:31:16,759
I'm very glad you recognised
me from the, um...

434
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,639
Well, we met at the funeral, didn't we?

435
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,980
- Mm. Yeah.
- Mm.

436
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:29,920
Um, what I'm keen to
ascertain is... is whether...

437
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:37,059
What I mean to say is, do you
think that, uh, Kenny, was happy?

438
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,460
Do you think?

439
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:45,059
He used to sing to himself
when he was on the loo.

440
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,840
S Club 7, mostly.

441
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,960
- And he liked the job?
- Loved it.

442
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,659
He missed you, though.

443
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,140
He said nobody kicked
his arse like you did.

444
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,410
I could be hard on him.

445
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,879
My mum told me I was
brilliant at everything,

446
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,639
even when I wasn't.

447
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,739
I spent four years
trying to be an artist

448
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,060
without any actual talent.

449
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,199
Being hard on someone is
sometimes what they need.

450
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,630
The ancient Celts used to
mourn their loved ones

451
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,199
with wailing and shrieking.

452
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,600
It was just a public ritual for them.

453
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,760
They weren't embarrassed
about it in the least.

454
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,043
Don't be embarrassed, will you?

455
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,800
There you are!

456
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,619
I said...

457
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,510
Can I get in?

458
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,099
Can I turn this... ?

459
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,630
Okay.

460
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,670
Are you coming in to work?

461
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,299
There's no point.

462
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,710
Why?

463
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,630
There's no point coming in because
I'm not allowed to do my work.

464
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,979
And there's no point in going
home because my daughter...

465
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:54,079
... is taking over the house, wanting...

466
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,439
... to talk.

467
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,590
Well, you can't just sit here.

468
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,390
I can.

469
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:07,100
I've got my sandwiches. I'm fine.

470
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,720
What a way to go.

471
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,950
Sorry?

472
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,140
What a terrible death.

473
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,419
Dido...

474
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,139
... abandoned by Aeneas...

475
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,150
... dies of grief.

476
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,100
Oh, right.

477
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,390
I can't...

478
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,590
... solve it, Mo.

479
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,950
I can't investigate it.

480
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,310
My hands are tied.

481
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,670
It's my son...

482
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:26,560
... and I can't... solve it.

483
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,679
I need to speak with Carolyn.

484
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,122
I'm not sure she's really up for...

485
00:35:40,123 --> 00:35:41,643
Mum?

486
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,799
It's all right.

487
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:55,259
Geraldine, why don't you go and
do your thing, where you...

488
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,819
... close your eyes and breathe?

489
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,242
Do you mean sleep?

490
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:00,723
Go ahead.

491
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,962
Eve, if you have come here to
berate me about the other day,

492
00:36:08,963 --> 00:36:10,699
do you mind if we do it in the morning?

493
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,080
- I'm a little tired.
- I have Kenny's phone.

494
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,240
I see.

495
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:19,163
I need to know what
happened, who killed him.

496
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,619
Well...

497
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,079
... as you know...

498
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,059
... in the field, when someone dies,

499
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:31,950
they can... fuel you, in a good way.

500
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,560
But this is different.

501
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,242
Do you understand?

502
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:42,990
I understand.

503
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,980
All right.

504
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,310
I miss his smell.

505
00:36:58,123 --> 00:36:59,603
Carolyn...

506
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,619
What do you want from me?

507
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,839
There's a thumb drive he was working on.

508
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,859
The police have it.

509
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,679
We need to get a hold of it.

510
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,419
We need to crack into it.

511
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,430
We'll keep it confidential.

512
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,723
_

513
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,800
Nice place.

514
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,642
No...

515
00:37:45,643 --> 00:37:48,283
- Oh, yes.
- No.

516
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,679
- No.
- No?!

517
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,803
- Really?!
- Aah!

518
00:37:51,804 --> 00:37:54,639
Oh! Oh! No! Stop!

519
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,779
You do not get to come here
without an invitation anymore!

520
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,099
Fine!

521
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,163
Fine.

522
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,640
Can I please come to see you?

523
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,499
Aagh!

524
00:38:16,883 --> 00:38:18,799
I'll think about it.

525
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,340
Ohh...

526
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,440
Oh!

527
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,039
Oh, God...

528
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,239
Oh, I missed you.

529
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,419
- Hmm.
- You look good.

530
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,083
Haven't you heard?

531
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,319
I'm moving up in the world.

532
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,639
Really?

533
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,843
They're making me a Keeper.

534
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,429
- Who told you that?
- Dasha.

535
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,439
- Dasha?
- Mm.

536
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,399
You trust Dasha after
what she did to you?

537
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,602
I trust her more than I trust you.

538
00:38:46,603 --> 00:38:49,083
You always said you
were going to kill her.

539
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,799
If I killed everybody who betrayed me,

540
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,239
there would be nobody left.

541
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,479
You know I had no choice in Rome.

542
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,603
Ah, I hope your family was worth it.

543
00:38:58,604 --> 00:39:01,519
That's up for debate.

544
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,419
Look...

545
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,642
... now you're back with
The Twelve, especially now,

546
00:39:07,643 --> 00:39:09,559
you have to know,

547
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,880
- you're not safe.
- I'm fine.

548
00:39:10,883 --> 00:39:13,082
You think you're in control,
but you are not.

549
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,899
And you think I'm going to listen to you

550
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,443
- after everything that you did?
- Okay, fine.

551
00:39:17,444 --> 00:39:20,599
There's something else.

552
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,519
Eve...

553
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,163
... she is alive.

554
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,779
It's not possible.

555
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,899
I saw her with my own eyes.

556
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,699
I shot her.

557
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,419
When you get angry and run away

558
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,482
without checking if the
person is actually dead...

559
00:39:38,483 --> 00:39:41,119
... miracles happen.

560
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,879
But don't go to London.

561
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,259
I don't want anything to happen to you.

562
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:52,710
Villanelle?

563
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,599
Villanelle?

564
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,460
Villanelle...

565
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,520
I'm fine.

566
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,600
Really, I'm fine. You should go.

567
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,979
How do you know I'm
back with The Twelve?

568
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,299
'Cause I never stopped working for them.

569
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,039
You know I care about you.

570
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,540
I know you're full of shit.

571
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,430
Can't it be both?

572
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,710
Oh...

573
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,563
