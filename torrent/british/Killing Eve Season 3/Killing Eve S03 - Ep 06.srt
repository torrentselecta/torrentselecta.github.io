You're awake.

Every time I visit,
he's asleep.

6
00:00:13,254 --> 00:00:14,428
I wonder why.

7
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:17,672
Did the doctors come by?

8
00:00:17,707 --> 00:00:18,708
They did.

9
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:23,368
And?

10
00:00:23,402 --> 00:00:25,404
And he getting better.

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,407
But he must avoid all stress.

12
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:30,720
You're stress.

13
00:00:30,754 --> 00:00:33,861
Coming from you, Maciek,
that's pretty rich.

14
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:35,587
The first time I meet you,

15
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:36,657
I tell him,

16
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:38,452
"Don't marry her.

17
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:41,075
"She will be
great big ball-ache."

18
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,045
"She will make your life
a total nightmare."

19
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:11,726
It's so good to see your eyes.

20
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:19,527
I am gonna find out
why this happened to you.

21
00:01:19,562 --> 00:01:21,081

It's more comfortable.

27
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:39,504
I've wanted to meet
you for a long time.

28
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:41,644
I've been watching you.

29
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:46,821
Er, watching in a kinky way?

30
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,789
You're remarkable.

Helene.

36
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,993
Is that your real name?

37
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:25,066
Do you know why I wanted
to meet you in person?

38
00:03:29,174 --> 00:03:30,520
To watch me some more?

39
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:34,973
I wanted to
tell you face to face

40
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,492
that your request

41
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:37,838
has been successful.

42
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,880
It's official.

43
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:03,346
To Villanelle, the Keeper.

44
00:04:14,461 --> 00:04:18,465
Your first assignment in
your new role is very exciting.

45
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:20,743
A big job that will
cause a great stir.

46
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:32,755
A politician in Romania.

47
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:47,217
I was told I would be
giving orders.

48
00:04:47,873 --> 00:04:48,874
By who?

49
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:54,708
This is the same stuff
I was doing before.

50
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:57,020
This is bullshit.

51
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:04,346
You bargained
for what you wanted,

52
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:05,719
and we're giving it to you.

53
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:08,377
You'll get all the material
perks you were expecting.

54
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:09,861
What more do you want?

55
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:14,797
Enjoy Romania.

56
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:25,532
So, if the texts
weren't from Niko...

57
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:26,843
Villanelle must have sent them.

58
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:29,329
Making Eve
go to Poland to see...

59
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,089
Her husband being pitchforked.

60
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:34,679
Sorry.

61
00:05:34,713 --> 00:05:36,543
Which means Villanelle is...

62
00:05:36,577 --> 00:05:38,993
Stark raving mad.

63
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:41,341
This can't be about the bus.

64
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:42,859
What bus?

65
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:44,171
What did you do on the bus?

66
00:05:44,205 --> 00:05:46,346
She knows she can't touch him.

67
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,140
What's she saying here?

68
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:51,005
Er, she's saying
she's "still got it."

69
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:54,768
Actually, if she
still did have it,

70
00:05:54,802 --> 00:05:57,046
he'd be dead
and not just pitchforked.

71
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,673
Sorry.

72
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:07,746
Maybe she's trying
to torture you.

73
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:10,093
Not like this.

74
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:12,372
Am I being too harsh?

75
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:13,856
Wait, what's this?

76
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:17,722
Bertha Kruger.

77
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:18,826
The wife of Charles,

78
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:21,001
the, er, accountant
for The Twelve.

79
00:06:23,244 --> 00:06:24,487
Killed in Lyon.

80
00:06:24,522 --> 00:06:26,213
When? BEAR: Last week,

81
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:27,387
when you were gone.

82
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,219
Are you okay?

83
00:07:07,254 --> 00:07:08,428
I just want a muffin.

84
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:12,880
No one usually gets those.

85
00:07:14,606 --> 00:07:17,713
Ugh. Yeah.
Jan, 2011.

86
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,130
Here.

87
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:30,829
You know that it would be okay

88
00:07:30,864 --> 00:07:32,728
if you're not okay.

89
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:34,488
That is...

90
00:07:34,523 --> 00:07:37,146
I mean, aside from
Kenny dying which,

91
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,043
let's face it,

92
00:07:38,078 --> 00:07:39,666
is a bit of a blow.

93
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,977
And being lured to Poland

94
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:42,541
because you thought your
husband wanted you back,

95
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:45,188
when really it was just
to see him being punctured.

96
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,881
You're alone,
homeless,

97
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:49,020
and trying to figure out

98
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:51,022
who's killed all your friends.

99
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:52,679
I mean,
I'd be a total wreck.

100
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:54,474
Why won't you give me a break?

101
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:56,748
Sometimes you just
need to let it win.

102
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:09,143
Hmm.

103
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:13,216
I wanted to show you this.

104
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:17,013
Dasha Duzran.

105
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:20,085
That's who's responsible
for the '70s gymnast kill.

106
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,742
At least, that's what
all the rumors say.

107
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:23,364
Who is she?

108
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,573
An Olympic gymnast,

109
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:26,609
who supposedly
works for the KGB.

110
00:08:26,644 --> 00:08:29,267
They say it was The Chalk Kill

111
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,510
that got her recruited.

112
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:33,616
Why would
Villanelle imitate her?

113
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:35,722
Flattery and all that.

114
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:36,964
Hardly.

115
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:38,932
Where is this?

116
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:40,865
Oh, that's in Barcelona.

117
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:43,868
Yeah. She teaches
wee kids to do roly-polies.

118
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,974
Wha-what?

119
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:04,095
Eve.

120
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:06,442
Tell me everything
about Dasha Duzran.

121
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:14,554
I'm afraid you've
interrupted a rather delicate operation.

122
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,728
Drought can be endured,

123
00:09:16,763 --> 00:09:19,524
but rot is an instant killer.

124
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:22,285
Dasha.

125
00:09:23,148 --> 00:09:24,011
Oh, yes.

126
00:09:24,046 --> 00:09:25,288
Well, I first met her

127
00:09:25,323 --> 00:09:27,705
when she had just been
kicked out of the KGB.

128
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:29,292
Sorrento.

129
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:31,477
And the weather was
unusually hot for that time of year,

130
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,158
and I waited for her at a cafe.

131
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:35,298
And before she sat down,

132
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,369
she plucked a lemon from a tree,

133
00:09:37,404 --> 00:09:40,545
and took the most
enormous bite out of it,

134
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:43,341
rind and all.

135
00:09:44,998 --> 00:09:46,275
Why do you want to know?

136
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:51,970
I think she's running
Villanelle out of Barcelona.

137
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,042
Well, that is
a heady combination.

138
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:57,631
Villanelle and Dasha.
Volatile.

139
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,736
If I'm right,

140
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,910
Dasha knows where
Villanelle was last week.

141
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:03,257
Because, I don't think she
was the one who attacked Niko.

142
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:04,155
Interesting.

143
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:05,708
I think she was
in Lyon at the time,

144
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:06,951
killing Bertha Kruger.

145
00:10:08,297 --> 00:10:11,196
I hope that doesn't mean you're
thinking of going to Barcelona.

146
00:10:11,231 --> 00:10:12,715
Someone tried
to kill my husband,

147
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,337
I intend to find out who.

148
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:19,239
But if it's The Twelve, Eve...

149
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:22,863
Does it really matter who?

150
00:10:28,697 --> 00:10:30,595
I could say
the same about Kenny.

151
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:39,121
Just be very careful of Dasha.

152
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:44,436
She was the KGB's top assassin,

153
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:47,336
until she killed
one of their own.

154
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,511
I mean,
that's why she was exiled.

155
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:34,935
Irina!

156
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:49,650
What are you doing?

157
00:11:49,674 --> 00:11:51,641
I love
hockey! Irina's good.

158
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:52,988
That was the other team.

159
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:54,852
It is? Yes.

160
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:57,647
Oh. Go, other team!

161
00:11:57,682 --> 00:11:59,063
Villanelle.

162
00:11:59,097 --> 00:12:00,789
Do they sell hot dogs here?

163
00:12:00,823 --> 00:12:03,205
You can't watch sports
without a hot dog.

164
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:05,655
Villanelle!
What is going on?

165
00:12:06,656 --> 00:12:07,968
I'm coming with you.

166
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:10,937
Your plan to get out?
I'm in.

167
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:13,042
You're in?

168
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:14,595
It's exciting, huh?

169
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:16,528
How was your trip?

170
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:19,773
Er, turns out I'm excellent
at dung-throwing.

171
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:23,432
And your mother?

172
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:38,481
No, Villanelle.

173
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:40,621
She deserved it.

174
00:12:41,657 --> 00:12:43,072
Of course,
she deserved it.

175
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:45,799
Everyone's mother deserves it.

176
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:48,457
But you're not
supposed to do it.

177
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:49,976
You are supposed to grow up

178
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,230
and realize she isn't actually
evil. I don't want to talk about it.

179
00:12:52,254 --> 00:12:54,601
I don't want
to talk about it! She's just insane.

180
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,778
Where are we going?

181
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,400
It better be some place hot.

182
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:02,678
No, it's too late.

183
00:13:02,712 --> 00:13:04,473
You haven't even left.

184
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:06,682
It's too dangerous
for us all to go together.

185
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:12,964
Konstantin, please.

186
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:18,107
I send for you.

187
00:13:18,452 --> 00:13:19,764
Er, no.

188
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:22,318
No.

189
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:24,355
We can't go together.

190
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:26,288
They will be on to us
before we get there.

191
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:27,185
Get where?

192
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,669
You will know
when I send for you.

193
00:13:28,704 --> 00:13:30,706
Hmm, we'll go.

194
00:13:31,707 --> 00:13:33,398
Then, you can send for Irina.

195
00:13:34,883 --> 00:13:36,022
I can't do that.

196
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:40,820
Once we're safe,
you'll come. I promise.

197
00:13:42,891 --> 00:13:44,064
I don't believe you.

198
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:46,411
But that's the only
way we'll make it.

199
00:13:46,446 --> 00:13:48,828
You haven't told anyone
about this, have you?

200
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:52,935
Of course not.

201
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,800
Don't let them see you
even think about getting out.

202
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,008
Do you hear me?

203
00:13:57,043 --> 00:13:59,390
They'd kill you the
second they realize...

204
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,944
Oh, Irina.

205
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:02,990
Because of her.

206
00:14:03,014 --> 00:14:04,233
I just scored
in the final minute,

207
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:05,603
and you missed it.

208
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,673
That was good.

209
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:08,088
He's a really shit father.

210
00:14:08,123 --> 00:14:09,262
You should run away.

211
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:11,643
What is she doing here?

212
00:14:11,678 --> 00:14:14,474
Er, I'm planning
our travel arrangements.

213
00:14:14,508 --> 00:14:16,165
Please tell me you're joking.

214
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,339
She is joking.

215
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:18,927
I'm not going if she's with us.

216
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:21,205
Great!
Problem solved.

217
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:22,413
When do we leave?

218
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:24,346
Irina, you go and get changed.

219
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,934
We'll talk about this later.

220
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:27,142
Go.

221
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,732
I don't
think you really want this.

222
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:34,908
I want it!

223
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:36,151
You know what it means?

224
00:14:36,185 --> 00:14:38,808
It means you have
to leave everything,

225
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:42,709
the clothes,
apartment... and her.

226
00:14:42,743 --> 00:14:43,744
I know.

227
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,651
Don't let them see
something's up.

228
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:54,963
Promise me.

229
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:56,171
The plan only works

230
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:57,793
if nobody knows there is one.

231
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,315
I'll act totally normal.

232
00:15:02,349 --> 00:15:04,904
Then they'd definitely
know something's up.

233
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:38,385
Are you coming
to poker this week?

234
00:15:41,043 --> 00:15:42,217
What day is it?

235
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:44,667
Wednesday.

236
00:15:46,117 --> 00:15:47,291
This Wednesday.

237
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:54,539
I'm afraid I don't think I can.

238
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,129
That's a shame.

239
00:15:58,164 --> 00:16:00,683
Shirley's making her risotto.

240
00:16:00,718 --> 00:16:02,064
Mushroom?

241
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:03,341
Naturally.

242
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,450
Well, let me see what I can do.

243
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:14,559
Right. To the matter
at hand.

244
00:16:17,873 --> 00:16:18,943
Phone records.

245
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:22,360
Calls to and from
Kenny's work phone

246
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:24,017
the two days before he...

247
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:25,225
Died.

248
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,505
Was he working for you
around this time?

249
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:31,956
No.

250
00:16:34,062 --> 00:16:35,822
He'd left the service by then.

251
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:38,549
It's just...

252
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:42,415
There were several
incoming and outgoing calls

253
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:43,968
to a Russian number.

254
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:49,353
Anyway, I'll leave you
to go over it all.

255
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:53,978
Give me a shout if
you have any questions.

256
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:56,532
Thanks, Mike.

257
00:16:57,395 --> 00:16:59,052
I emailed this to your desk

258
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:00,502
over a week ago,
you know.

259
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:02,814
Really?

260
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:04,506
That's why I suggested this

261
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,439
when you asked where they were.

262
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:08,855
Didn't want them to get lost.

263
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,583
Let me know about Wednesday.

264
00:17:13,894 --> 00:17:17,001
You have to let us win it
back sometime, you know.

265
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:35,778
Ah! Hello, Carolyn.

266
00:17:35,813 --> 00:17:36,952
Time for P.E.?

267
00:17:36,986 --> 00:17:38,022
Indeed.

268
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,137
Do you think you could manage

269
00:17:39,161 --> 00:17:41,094
to get those
phone records to me?

270
00:17:41,129 --> 00:17:42,682
They're taking a very long time.

271
00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:45,892
Hmm. I, er, had a call
about those just this morning.

272
00:17:45,926 --> 00:17:48,964
Scotland Yard dragging
their feet, as per.

273
00:17:48,998 --> 00:17:50,759
Shouldn't be too much longer.

274
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:57,559
What?

275
00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:05,014
Are you...

276
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,882
working for them, Paul?

277
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:14,023
Excuse me?

278
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:24,931
Are you?

279
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:30,523
Are you, Carolyn?

280
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:35,838
Why on Earth
would you ask me that?

281
00:18:37,426 --> 00:18:39,601
Well, the same reason
you asked me.

282
00:18:41,672 --> 00:18:43,536
Because we don't
trust each other.

283
00:18:47,298 --> 00:18:48,472
Should I...

284
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,648
trust you?

285
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,171
Heavens, no.

286
00:18:58,206 --> 00:18:59,897
None of us are to be trusted,

287
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,968
that's why we work here.

288
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:03,107
Quite.

289
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:06,248
Well, I'd best be off,

290
00:19:06,283 --> 00:19:07,767
I have an appointment.

291
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:10,597
Right.

292
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:12,496
Carolyn.

293
00:19:14,118 --> 00:19:15,154
This is your office.

294
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:21,712
Oh.

295
00:19:23,231 --> 00:19:24,853
That's very good light.

296
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:06,481
Was that your boyfriend?

297
00:20:06,515 --> 00:20:08,345
My mum's boyfriend.

298
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:09,932
Is he a pervert?

299
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:11,762
No. He's just...

300
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:15,869
really, really... nice.

301
00:20:20,564 --> 00:20:21,979
You want to bunk off?

302
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,605
Do you think I'm dumb?

303
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,193
I'm not going anywhere with you.

304
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,815
Come on!
It'll be fun.

305
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:34,578
We can do anything you want.

306
00:20:37,305 --> 00:20:38,478
Anything.

307
00:21:01,363 --> 00:21:03,089
You'll need me
to help you translate.

308
00:21:03,123 --> 00:21:05,574
I remember your languages
were...

309
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:08,128
Piss off!
I'm fluent in Spanish.

310
00:21:09,198 --> 00:21:12,098
Ooh, Spanish.

311
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:17,137
I know what you're trying to do.

312
00:21:17,172 --> 00:21:18,587
You're not coming with us.

313
00:21:18,622 --> 00:21:20,555
I bet you
get homesick in a week.

314
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:21,625
No, I won't.

315
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:22,902
The heat will be awful.

316
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,905
You'll have to wax all the time.

317
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:27,838
You're so old.

318
00:21:27,872 --> 00:21:29,771
People don't just wax any more.

319
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:31,945
I don't want to look
like a 12-year-old girl.

320
00:21:33,395 --> 00:21:34,707
You are a 12-year-old girl.

321
00:21:34,741 --> 00:21:36,536
I'm 14!

322
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:40,091
Where is your Dad?

323
00:21:41,438 --> 00:21:42,715
London.

324
00:21:42,749 --> 00:21:44,372
So, you're stuck with your mum?

325
00:21:44,406 --> 00:21:45,442
Don't remind me.

326
00:21:45,476 --> 00:21:47,167
Mums are the worst, right?

327
00:21:47,202 --> 00:21:48,307
You know how annoying it is

328
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:50,205
when you have to be
around two people in love?

329
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:51,344
Ugh.

330
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:52,942
Well, imagine one of
those people is your mum.

331
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:55,797
It's disgusting.
He's disgusting.

332
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:57,246
If it's that bad,
kill him.

333
00:21:57,281 --> 00:22:00,008
You're a
real role model, you know that?

334
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:02,390
Oh, my
God! You're really bad.

335
00:22:02,424 --> 00:22:06,842
The humidity in South America
will not be kind to that hair.

336
00:22:06,877 --> 00:22:09,983
Cuba's in
North America, you idiot!

337
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:11,122
Cuba!

338
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:14,505
Cuba!

339
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:17,888
You are totally delusional.

340
00:22:40,497 --> 00:22:42,499
Shall we go for a drive?

341
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:43,707
Mmm.

342
00:22:53,993 --> 00:22:55,097
This is nice.

343
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,961
Is it?

344
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,379
How are you?

345
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:02,381
Galvanized.

346
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:03,727
I can see that.

347
00:23:05,694 --> 00:23:07,282
Are you in a rush?

348
00:23:07,316 --> 00:23:09,698
Not rushed,
just impatient.

349
00:23:11,631 --> 00:23:13,978
Are we going
somewhere in particular?

350
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,255
Yes.

351
00:23:16,464 --> 00:23:18,189
Are you going to tell me where?

352
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:20,364
No.

353
00:23:27,544 --> 00:23:28,579
What are you doing?

354
00:23:28,614 --> 00:23:30,167
Give me your wallet. Why?

355
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:31,617
Just give me your wallet.

356
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,310
What the hell are you doing?

357
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:40,315
What did you want with my child?

358
00:23:41,627 --> 00:23:43,491
I'm going to
ask you again, Konstantin,

359
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:44,985
and you're going
to answer me correctly.

360
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:46,908
What did you want with my child?

361
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:49,151
I swear, I try nothing.

362
00:23:49,186 --> 00:23:50,429
She kissed me.

363
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,052
Geri kissed you.

364
00:23:59,783 --> 00:24:01,681
You don't have to do this.

365
00:24:01,716 --> 00:24:03,614
I already know you are scary.

366
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:05,996
Why did Kenny call you
the night before he died?

367
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:07,825
Konstantin?

368
00:24:08,343 --> 00:24:09,378
Konstantin?

369
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:12,554
Okay, okay.
He called me.

370
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:14,142
What did you get him into?

371
00:24:14,176 --> 00:24:15,177
Nothing.

372
00:24:16,524 --> 00:24:17,870
If you don't tell me...

373
00:24:17,904 --> 00:24:19,624
I don't know what
this is, or what you're...

374
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,535
Tell me.

375
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,295
He ask if I was his father.

376
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:32,712
Hey.

377
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,476
What did you tell him?

378
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:39,961
I told...

379
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:41,928
I told him I didn't know.

380
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:16,100
Get out.

381
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:53,137
You're cooking.

382
00:25:56,313 --> 00:25:58,487
I thought we were
having veg stew tonight.

383
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:02,595
I really just felt
like a pork pie,

384
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,872
if I'm honest.

385
00:26:03,907 --> 00:26:06,081
I went shopping specifically.

386
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:12,571
They're wonky.

387
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:14,158
The ones that no one wanted.

388
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:18,991
Geri, are you comparing
yourself to a carrot?

389
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:25,791
I know you don't
like me very much... Geri.

390
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:27,965
And now you have to
put up with me because

391
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,967
you and I are all that's left

392
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:32,073
of this family, and...

393
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:34,247
I don't love being here either,

394
00:26:34,282 --> 00:26:36,629
having you treat me
like I'm some kind of

395
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:37,941
idiotic annoyance

396
00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:40,909
whose intellectual power
could never match up to yours.

397
00:26:40,944 --> 00:26:42,359
Could we do this after we've...

398
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,810
But I choose to stay because...

399
00:26:45,845 --> 00:26:47,398
Because you're all I have, too.

400
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:49,573
And I thought that
maybe we'd learn to...

401
00:26:50,574 --> 00:26:52,058
I don't know,

402
00:26:52,093 --> 00:26:54,992
do more than just
tolerate each other.

403
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:56,545
It would be so much better

404
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,031
if we could have this
conversation after I've eaten.

405
00:27:02,448 --> 00:27:03,518
All right.

406
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,039
All right.

407
00:27:14,563 --> 00:27:15,841
You were your father's.

408
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:22,226
And Kenny was mine.

409
00:27:25,022 --> 00:27:28,612
And that is how things
were when we were all alive.

410
00:27:30,614 --> 00:27:32,443
He understood you and you him,

411
00:27:32,478 --> 00:27:33,962
in a way I never did.

412
00:27:33,997 --> 00:27:36,206
And I understood Kenny
and he me,

413
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,586
in a way your father never did.

414
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:40,935
So... No.

415
00:27:42,108 --> 00:27:44,076
You're not easy
for me to understand.

416
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:48,287
And I know I'm
not supposed to say that.

417
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:50,702
But it's the truth.

418
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:54,017
There's no more
can be said about it.

419
00:27:56,502 --> 00:27:58,815
Now, I can pretend

420
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:00,920
to enjoy wonky carrot stew

421
00:28:00,955 --> 00:28:03,474
and listen to gong bells

422
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:05,280
and all the other inane
things that interest you,

423
00:28:05,304 --> 00:28:07,927
but I don't,
because I can't lie,

424
00:28:07,962 --> 00:28:09,239
do you see?

425
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,896
I know other parents do,

426
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:11,976
they tell their children they're

427
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,830
wonderful at this
and great at that,

428
00:28:13,864 --> 00:28:15,038
but I just...

429
00:28:16,108 --> 00:28:18,110
I don't have that gene.

430
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:20,112
So...

431
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,461
To you,
I am harsh and cold,

432
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:28,845
and to me you are
disappointed and expected.

433
00:28:29,949 --> 00:28:31,123
Oh!

434
00:28:36,335 --> 00:28:37,405
Ooh.

435
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:50,729
But you're right,
Geraldine.

436
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,111
All we've got left
is each other.

437
00:28:55,803 --> 00:28:58,737
So, you make your stew and
I'll try and pretend to enjoy it.

438
00:29:00,808 --> 00:29:02,533
And while I do,

439
00:29:02,568 --> 00:29:04,052
you can tell me exactly

440
00:29:04,087 --> 00:29:06,952
what's been going on
between you and Konstantin.

441
00:29:06,986 --> 00:29:08,643
Where you've been,
what you've done,

442
00:29:08,677 --> 00:29:10,783
and why he came to visit you.

443
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:14,753
Because it seems while
I've been unable to lie to you,

444
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:17,790
you've had no problem

445
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:19,102
lying to me.

446
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:30,699
Call me when it's done.

447
00:29:49,857 --> 00:29:52,238
Where've you been?

448
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:55,966
Will people
stop waiting for me in the dark!

449
00:29:56,001 --> 00:29:58,866
Bit late for an evening stroll.

450
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,835
I was
trying to get my step-count up.

451
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,839
Hmm. You know, it turns out
Kruger wasn't the man we were after.

452
00:30:06,874 --> 00:30:09,497
No?
No.

453
00:30:09,531 --> 00:30:12,465
It was someone else who
was dipping into the honey pot.

454
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:16,607
Then why make me stay here?

455
00:30:16,642 --> 00:30:18,609
His wife, Bertha,

456
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:20,266
she's our focus now.

457
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:24,029
Because she was
stealing the funds?

458
00:30:24,063 --> 00:30:26,445
No, because she's dead.

459
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:28,792
Whoever ordered that hit
is who we want.

460
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:32,658
Do you have any idea
who'd want that woman dead?

461
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:34,453
Why would I?

462
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:37,905
Does this mean
I can leave London?

463
00:30:39,492 --> 00:30:42,564
It means the
job description's changed.

464
00:30:43,531 --> 00:30:45,222
Find out who gave that order,

465
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:46,568
whatever it takes.

466
00:30:48,122 --> 00:30:49,848
If there's a breach,
we're both to blame,

467
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:51,125
but believe me,

468
00:30:52,126 --> 00:30:54,059
you will be the one who'll fall.

469
00:31:20,257 --> 00:31:21,638
Up for a game?

470
00:31:26,815 --> 00:31:27,816
You're up.

471
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:43,867
Total fluke.

472
00:31:55,189 --> 00:31:56,259
So why you here?

473
00:31:56,293 --> 00:31:58,917
You want to ask
about my gold medals?

474
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:00,677
Oh, I thought it was bronze.

475
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:01,747
Do you know who I am?

476
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:04,163
I know you're working
for The Twelve.

477
00:32:04,198 --> 00:32:05,820
I know you're working with her.

478
00:32:06,752 --> 00:32:07,753
Your turn.

479
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:16,969
You bowl a lot?

480
00:32:17,004 --> 00:32:18,453
Never.

481
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:21,249
I noticed the way Villanelle
copied your first kill.

482
00:32:22,147 --> 00:32:23,493
Very original.

483
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:26,254
She must really admire you.

484
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:30,672
Though, whoever
tried to imitate her

485
00:32:30,707 --> 00:32:32,329
did a really poor job.

486
00:32:32,364 --> 00:32:33,744
My husband's still alive.

487
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,163
You don't talk to people
when they are bowling.

488
00:32:39,336 --> 00:32:40,682
That was a strike.

489
00:32:40,717 --> 00:32:42,167
Did they send her to kill Kenny?

490
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:43,237
My God,

491
00:32:43,271 --> 00:32:45,170
is this what
she has to deal with?

492
00:32:45,204 --> 00:32:46,481
Where is she?

493
00:32:46,516 --> 00:32:48,276
Just because you
don't want it to be her,

494
00:32:48,311 --> 00:32:49,519
doesn't mean it wasn't.

495
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:50,416
It wasn't.

496
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:52,936
Do you know she's been promoted?

497
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,007
She will never be loyal to you.

498
00:32:55,042 --> 00:32:56,043
And she's loyal to you?

499
00:32:56,077 --> 00:32:57,458
Aye, she respects me.

500
00:32:57,492 --> 00:32:58,700
Really?

501
00:32:58,735 --> 00:33:00,495
I created her.

502
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:04,361
I took raw shit and
moulded it into steel.

503
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:07,640
I broke her back,
I gave her wings.

504
00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:09,746
She's perfect killing machine.

505
00:33:10,643 --> 00:33:12,093
That's all she's there for.

506
00:33:12,128 --> 00:33:13,784
That's all she knows.

507
00:33:13,819 --> 00:33:14,993
I don't think so.

508
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:18,306
Oh, you think she cares
what you think?

509
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:22,000
She's moving up in the world.

510
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:23,760
You'll never touch her now.

511
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,367
You think you are winning.

512
00:33:44,401 --> 00:33:47,197
You will never win at this game.

513
00:33:47,232 --> 00:33:49,406
You can't beat us.
You understand?

514
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:53,410
I can kill you...
any time.

515
00:34:00,797 --> 00:34:01,798
End of game.

516
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,750
She's off sick today.

517
00:34:57,785 --> 00:34:58,786
Hmm.

518
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,374
Don't worry.

519
00:35:00,408 --> 00:35:02,410
I'm going to make you
look amazing.

520
00:36:14,482 --> 00:36:17,416
Irina, school's out
early this year.

521
00:36:17,451 --> 00:36:18,728
Be ready.

522
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,608
What the hell have you done?

523
00:36:36,642 --> 00:36:37,988
I'm done with this shit.

524
00:36:40,474 --> 00:36:42,096
I'm done with it.
I'm leaving.

525
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,926
What do you mean you're leaving?

526
00:36:44,961 --> 00:36:46,997
Oh, I've got to get out of here.

527
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:54,315
How was your meeting
with Helene?

528
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,179
That's not her real name.

529
00:36:57,525 --> 00:36:59,113
Look at you.

530
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,427
I'm a Keeper now.

531
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:05,533
You get to go home.

532
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:10,158
You think I get to go home
after this disaster?

533
00:37:14,922 --> 00:37:17,580
Here, give it to me,
give it to me.

534
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:21,446
You can...

535
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,413
You can pinch it
with this, go on.

536
00:37:23,448 --> 00:37:24,966
Yeah, grab it.

537
00:37:28,763 --> 00:37:30,075
Pinch it.

538
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:42,674
Good.

539
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,163
Come on.

540
00:38:11,703 --> 00:38:13,083
So, what happened?

541
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:18,882
I don't want
to do this any more.

542
00:38:23,197 --> 00:38:24,198
Come on.

543
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:29,134
Just clean yourself up,

544
00:38:29,168 --> 00:38:30,929
and I'll order pizza.

545
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:36,106
Hmm? Okay.
