1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,969
What's the deal with you and Villanelle?

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,279
I hate to be strict, but she
really mustn't kill anyone.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,749
Eve would never forgive me
if I hurt you, Niko.

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,281
Kenny, I didn't know you'd be here!

5
00:00:09,282 --> 00:00:10,840
This is a setup.

6
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,159
You're the person who made
this whole operation possible.

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,869
You should let yourself go.

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,219
That's what you leave behind.

9
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,709
It's finished.

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,989
I've got to go home.

11
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,999
I thought you were special.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,600
Sorry to disappoint.

14
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,290
... especially if that love,

15
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,769
introduces themselves,

16
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,679
by marching up to you in
the middle of the airport,

17
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,530
saying, "I'm going
wherever you are going."

18
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,650
This day, this speech,

19
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,500
and this toast...

20
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,610
is for us.

21
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,260
We love you!

22
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,268
If I'd have known getting married
would be this much fun,

23
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,841
I'd have done it loads more by now.

24
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,721
When I first met Maria...

25
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,417
I thought, "Great shoes."

26
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:34,579
But then I learned,

27
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,327
there's so much more to her than that.

28
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:38,197
She also has a great house,

29
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:42,209
and a pool and tailor.

30
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,749
Hairdresser.

31
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,290
It really is the all-around
excellent package.

32
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,001
When we met...

33
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,100
I'd just had a really bad breakup.

34
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,830
It was really bad.

35
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,240
But when I think about my ex today...

36
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,660
I realise...

37
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,561
I am so much happier now she's dead.

38
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,601
This is my special day.

39
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,999
Sincere... congratulations!

40
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,970
Stop it! Stop!

41
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,399
Apparently, I've lost their trust.

42
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,579
Was that something you
ever wanted to find?

43
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,739
Not quite. The problem being,

44
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,579
they've brought someone
in to oversee the desk.

45
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,719
Someone dreadful, I might add.

46
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,279
You're joking.

47
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,439
Diane doesn't joke.

48
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,580
She's too constricted.

49
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,939
And she specifically chose,
a Whitehall Warrior

50
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,489
in a rather successful
attempt to irritate me.

51
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,379
So we're basically being overseen

52
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,679
by a massive wanker.

53
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,499
- Precisely.
- What would you like?

54
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,020
Orecchiette please, Sam.

55
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,809
I mean, Diane's been waiting for years

56
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,321
to strike back at me,
and now's her chance.

57
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,109
She is a prime example of upper level

58
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,280
preventing the real
work from being done.

59
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,960
Bureaucracy in all its glory.

60
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:57,089
Parmigiano?

61
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,189
Carolyn?

62
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,320
Here we go.

63
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,160
I hear you've been very naughty.

64
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:08,521
Have I? How thrilling.

65
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,039
This is Mo Jafari.

66
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,000
A very promising young agent,

67
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:16,569
who I unearthed in Comms of all places.

68
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,569
Mo, Paul Bradwell.

69
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,849
Paul was once the rising star of MI6

70
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,200
until he defected to the other side.

71
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:24,429
I don't think the Foreign Office

72
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,589
can be considered the
other side, Carolyn.

73
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,681
Don't you?

74
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,559
I'm back now, with bells on.

75
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,039
So we can hear you coming?

76
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,519
Oh, we're always like this, aren't we?

77
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,069
Yes. Yes, we are.

78
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,769
Now listen, I understand
you're feeling a bit chippy,

79
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,909
but I honestly had no idea

80
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,960
they were going to ask
me to run the desk.

81
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,049
Oversee, Paul, not "run".

82
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,520
Oversee.

83
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:54,380
Whatever you say.

84
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,469
You know, I very nearly
called you over Christmas.

85
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,879
I was going through a terrible divorce

86
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,480
and I thought, if anybody knows

87
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:03,449
how to get through this, it's Carolyn.

88
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,340
She's done it enough times.

89
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,389
Divorces are easy.

90
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,600
It's marriages that are impossibly hard.

91
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:12,040
Are you joining us?

92
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,189
No, no, no. I have to dash.

93
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,481
Lunch with the chief.

94
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,321
We're going to make a fabulous team.

95
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,040
And, Carolyn,

96
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,469
I'm so sorry about the
whole office debacle.

97
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,160
They told me I had to take yours

98
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,389
as it was closer to the department.

99
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,681
Paul, I don't even know
where my office is.

100
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,689
Good luck with Diane.

101
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,939
I hear she's in a feisty mood.

102
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,639
Three clean-up operations, unauthorised.

103
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,409
The employment of former
MI5 agents, unauthorised.

104
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:52,309
Safe-housing an FSB agent...

105
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,080
Unauthorised.

106
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:55,509
Former agent, Hugo Turner,

107
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,199
who is currently, suing MI6

108
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,640
for injuries incurred during
your operation in Rome,

109
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:02,809
also unauthorised.

110
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,629
£416.27, unpaid lunches

111
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,240
at the canteen.

112
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:12,400
And that's to say nothing
of Polastri's fate.

113
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:15,961
Well, Carolyn, what on earth do
you have to say for yourself?

114
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,030
Hey, watch it!

115
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,850
Screw you.

116
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,579
We have been watching you since Rome.

117
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,040
You know that, don't you?

118
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,429
You're not easy to replace.

119
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,159
You should see some of the cretins

120
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,689
they send for me to train.

121
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,881
If you did ever want back in,

122
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,041
I can get you more of everything.

123
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,319
Money, travel, apartment.

124
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,840
All better than you've ever had.

125
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:07,240
You're so talented.

126
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:09,569
You're the best I ever trained.

127
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,720
- You're destined for greatness.
- "Destined for greatness."

128
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:13,249
It's true.

129
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,089
You have brilliant career
ahead of you, Oksana...

130
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,881
Do you think I'm stupid?

131
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:22,060
Do you think I'm stupid?

132
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,440
I'm still champion.

133
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:35,761
Best out of three.

134
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,960
Kopveska?

135
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:42,319
- I get them imported to...
- Yeah!

136
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,229
Hey, that is cheating.

137
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,369
So...

138
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,589
If I do ever want to come back,

139
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,820
and you give me all
this amazing stuff...

140
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,560
What's in it for you?

141
00:15:01,561 --> 00:15:03,309
Hmm?

142
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,589
Knowing my most talented student

143
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,120
is doing work of her destiny.

144
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:09,109
Uh-uh.

145
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,189
I repeat...

146
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,121
What is in it for you?

147
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,120
If I get you back and working well...

148
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,200
they will send me home, to Russia.

149
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:31,069
Whatever you want, I will do it.

150
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,859
I will get you anything.

151
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,441
Just tell me.

152
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,960
Trust me.

153
00:15:40,961 --> 00:15:42,829
Power is there for the taking, Oksana.

154
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,079
You just have to be smart about how.

155
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,360
Slowly, slowly, catch a monkey.

156
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,721
A Keeper.

157
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,069
I want to be a Keeper.

158
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,369
A Keeper is big.

159
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,629
Higher than Konstantin,
it's higher than me.

160
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,801
You said what I wanted,
that's what I want.

161
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,549
Ah-ha. Okay, okay.

162
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,209
We... We can work with this.

163
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,400
- Right?
- Yeah, we can work with this.

164
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:13,889
She wants to be Keeper.

165
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,699
"Oksana, the Keeper."

166
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,519
Oksana wants to be Keeper.

167
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,769
Oksana, the Keeper.

168
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,001
I will go to them tomorrow
and I will say she wants...

169
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:27,740
"Villanelle."

170
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,401
You call me Villanelle.

171
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,200
Okay. Okay. Villanelle.

172
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,789
- Are you all right?
- Ow!

173
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,189
No, I'm not.

174
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,561
Some bastard's been stealing
my Tangfastics again.

175
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,349
Better call in the troops.

176
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,929
Well, you joke, but theft
is theft, my friend.

177
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,590
Tangfastics today, data tomorrow.

178
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,850
- Hi.
- Hey.

179
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,739
Pop quiz tonight?

180
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,359
Erm, I can't this evening.

181
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,080
But we need you for all
the football questions.

182
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:40,721
I'm meeting someone.

183
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,440
A friend.

184
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:45,720
And I'm not the only one
who knows about football.

185
00:17:45,721 --> 00:17:47,320
You have friends?

186
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:48,650
Ha.

187
00:17:52,241 --> 00:17:53,699
You realise to fit in here,

188
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,959
you have to be socially inept

189
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,479
like the rest of us.

190
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,641
Oh, I'm that too. Don't worry.

191
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,659
So, who's the friend?

192
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,840
It's erm... It's nothing, really.

193
00:18:09,921 --> 00:18:12,879
You know, a normal person
would flake on their friend

194
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,039
when something better turns up.

195
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,920
Well, remind me not to
rely on you for anything.

196
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,879
I liked your piece on evasive
jellyfish migration, by the way.

197
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,869
Thanks. I liked yours.

198
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,019
Oh, wait, you haven't
written anything, have you?

199
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,479
I'm working on it.

200
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,241
I don't care!

201
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:32,640
No, you promised us...

202
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:36,280
You said he doesn't push it
if it's not ready, right?

203
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,841
I said that about me.

204
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,189
Look, I could help you,
if you tell me what it's about.

205
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,241
I don't really know yet.

206
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,361
Okay, then.

207
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,380
Unbelievable!

208
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,000
I will find you.

209
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,480
I like the kitchen.

210
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,340
I like the kitchen.

211
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,361
Okay.

212
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:39,681
I'll take this.

213
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,939
This is sweet.

214
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,389
- Are you visiting?
- Yes.

215
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,440
No. This is for my daughter.

216
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:52,539
She likes London, does she?

217
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,620
She hates everything about it.

218
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,561
That's why I'm sending it.

219
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:01,630
One and two,

220
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,059
and stretch your legs!

221
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,760
And finish!

222
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,560
Are you crying? Don't be a wimp.

223
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:19,379
When you really, really
want to piss her off,

224
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,119
you say, "Russia is a corrupt state,

225
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,879
clinging to the shadows
of its Soviet glory."

226
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,099
You see this woman?
She was useless just like you,

227
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,479
but I showed her how to be strong.

228
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,240
- And fight dirty.
- Yes.

229
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:35,001
Fight dirty, but listen to Dasha.

230
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:38,080
Now piss off.

231
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:39,680
And tomorrow, I want you on fire.

232
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:48,080
I scared the shit out of them.

233
00:22:48,081 --> 00:22:49,150
Really?

234
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,819
They're open to it.

235
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,699
That doesn't sound like a yes.

236
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,699
They'll promote you with full benefits,

237
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,859
but first you have to show them

238
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,579
you're up to the job.

239
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,640
No. That's not what I asked for.

240
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:04,379
It's a process.

241
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,220
Nothing good comes fast. You know that.

242
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,589
- Slowly, slowly...
- Enough with the monkey!

243
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,399
A good solid job, nice,

244
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,441
political agitator...

245
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,839
and local, too.

246
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,469
Plus, big, fat, welcome-home bonus.

247
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,749
Have fun with it.

248
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,769
Your work was always
so inventive and fresh.

249
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,089
Almost as good as mine.

250
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,179
Better than yours.

251
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,429
- Hmm?
- Hmm.

252
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,699
You know they still study my kills,

253
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,209
for their brilliance?

254
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,699
My work remains totally untouchable...

255
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,480
Because it's out of date.

256
00:23:39,481 --> 00:23:41,601
Do you want this job or not?

257
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,880
Shit.

258
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,449
First message.

259
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,761
Second message.

260
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,539
Dad, you need to come home now.

261
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,939
Mum's driving me crazy

262
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,000
and her sack of shit boyfriend is...

263
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,960
Delivery?

264
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,139
... a total dick.

265
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,899
And I need you to come back and get me.

266
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,099
Why are you still in that damp
dump of a country anyway?

267
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,719
You said you'd be back in a few weeks,

268
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,210
but it's been...

269
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,499
What the hell are you doing here?

270
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,059
I'm sorry! I'm sorry. You texted me.

271
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,159
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

272
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,529
It didn't make a lot of sense.

273
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,399
Something about "loo paper, beer"?

274
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,919
Oh. Oh, God.

275
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,389
I was a bit worried if I'm honest,

276
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,999
so I tracked your phone.

277
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,779
You know, you really shouldn't
leave your front door open,

278
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,799
considering the amount of people

279
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,999
that have tried to kill you.

280
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,209
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

281
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,419
I'm really, really sorry

282
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,429
- about what went down.
- No, no, no.

283
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,099
- Let me say it.
- It's really best if you didn't.

284
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,561
- I prefer things...
- Buried.

285
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,620
Exactly.

286
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,321
Well, that's very... British.

287
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

288
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,979
I went to see you,

289
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,719
after they transported you

290
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,559
- from the hospital in Rome.
- Really?

291
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,470
But they weren't allowing visitors

292
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,090
and I felt a bit, erm...

293
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,721
Lucky those tourists
found you when they did.

294
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,169
You missing MI6?

295
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,019
Absolutely not.

296
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,700
- How is it?
- I have no idea. I quit.

297
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,499
I've started working at Bitter Pill.

298
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,539
You're a journalist?

299
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,469
"Open-source investigator"
is the official title.

300
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,339
No way.

301
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,960
It's been decent, to be fair.

302
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,999
The site's good

303
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,089
and they let me investigate what I want.

304
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,909
The guy who runs it is pretty cool.

305
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,939
Working for someone
with integrity, it's...

306
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,890
Better than working for your mom.

307
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,801
Let's just say, different.

308
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,569
- You still in touch with...
- Oh, God. No.

309
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,340
I'm totally done with her.
Done with that.

310
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,721
End of story.

311
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,321
I was gonna say Niko.

312
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,899
Oh. Right.

313
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,919
Of course, I...

314
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,740
Yeah, we see each other
every few days. He's...

315
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,439
- You know.
- Yeah, I heard.

316
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,361
And what about you?

317
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,739
Do you ever worry about The Twelve?

318
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,121
There are plenty of other
people worrying about them.

319
00:28:20,122 --> 00:28:21,129
But there's not.

320
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,699
MI6 shut everything down months ago.

321
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,279
Yeah, well, it's not my problem anymore.

322
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,401
- Yeah. Yeah, not our problem.
- Kenny, it's not.

323
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,079
- So I've been looking into them loads.
- No shit.

324
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,739
And I was looking at the
financial trial again.

325
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,099
And the thing is, after Fat Panda

326
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,119
- and Frank, there were...
- Kenny...

327
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,139
I've seen some activity in
their accounts that show...

328
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,929
Kenny, I'm serious. I am not
going down that road again.

329
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,681
It almost killed me.

330
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,539
You should come to the office

331
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,489
after work for beers.

332
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,889
I'm there most evenings and weekends.

333
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:08,509
I think you could do with
people, or something.

334
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,619
- You don't seem very, er...
- No, Kenny, I'm fine.

335
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,809
I know.

336
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,321
You just don't seem
very happy. That's all.

337
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,001
Who says I want to be happy?

338
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,190
- Bye.
- Bye.

339
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,561
Ahhh!

340
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,480
Untouchable.

341
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:50,161
♪ ... one another... ♪

342
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:55,599
♪ And between us ♪

343
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,819
♪ We have one... ♪

344
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,000
Kenny!

345
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,099
I thought you said you were going
to sort all this before we packed.

346
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,281
I did.

347
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:14,489
Memories.

348
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,279
You see this, and you're transported

349
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,840
- to a time of happiness?
- Yes.

350
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,840
I'll sort it when I'm back.

351
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,460
Now, you are the one who
persuaded me to make this move,

352
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,579
so you can just pitch in.

353
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,979
The thing is, I've got
some work stuff to do.

354
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,200
That website has you
working at the weekend?

355
00:33:29,201 --> 00:33:30,481
You had me working at the weekend.

356
00:33:30,482 --> 00:33:32,681
That's because people get
murdered at the weekend.

357
00:33:32,682 --> 00:33:35,719
- I'll see you when I'm back.
- As you wish.

358
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,439
It is as I wish, actually.

359
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,881
- Right.
- That's why I'm not staying.

360
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:41,361
- I think I got that.
- All right, then.

361
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,921
Because I'm not gonna be
told what to do any more.

362
00:33:48,922 --> 00:33:50,441
Clearly.

363
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,899
Are you ever going to apologise?

364
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,219
I think I'm at a loss here.

365
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,879
You really don't think you did
anything wrong at all, do you?

366
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,959
Your father chose our last house

367
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,299
and to be honest, I never liked it.

368
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,369
But I lived there for
years without complaint

369
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,519
because I knew it made him happy.

370
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,679
Life is just a series
of trade-offs, Kenny.

371
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,560
For all of us.

372
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,009
And my job is no different.

373
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,629
Now, you might disagree
with my decisions,

374
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,859
but I will never be able
to apologise for them.

375
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,569
And I'd have thought that if
anyone could understand that,

376
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,019
it's you.

377
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,521
Now, do you want fish and
chips for when you come back?

378
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,600
Okay.

379
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:33,841
- Battered sausage?
- Yes, please.

380
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,310
Right.

381
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,209
And it's not a website.
It's an online publication.

382
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,230
Oh, very good!

383
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:48,790
How are you feeling today?

384
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,350
- He's in the garden.
- Thank you.

385
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,760
I brought you these.

386
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,000
I ate the green ones for you.

387
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,961
Thanks.

388
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,560
They exchanged on the house.

389
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:16,121
I've got some stuff for you to sign.

390
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,999
- Just here.
- I know. Eve...

391
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,359
I'm not an idiot.

392
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,200
We are going to get through this.

393
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,719
You have to know that.

394
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,589
It's one day at a time,

395
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,168
and you are getting
better with every day...

396
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:35,139
This isn't something you can fix, Eve.

397
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,681
Her parents think she killed
herself, you know that?

398
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:42,399
Also, MI bloody six can
wash their hands...

399
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,279
It's better if her family don't know.

400
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,401
Better for who?

401
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,939
Our entire relationship has had you...

402
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,759
- at the centre of it.
- Well, I never wanted that...

403
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,469
Well, you didn't do much
to change it, did you?

404
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,761
And if we're being honest,

405
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:03,069
we'd both admit that I deserve more...

406
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,010
a bit more than that.

407
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,520
And more than you.

408
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,161
She's lying. Okay?

409
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,999
She was lying when she
had work the next day.

410
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,239
She was lying when saw her mom.

411
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,819
She was lying when she had the flu.

412
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,260
He knows it.

413
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,539
I know it.

414
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,249
You know it.

415
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,239
You're not even crying because of her.

416
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,219
You're crying because...

417
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,189
because you feel stupid.

418
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,201
Because you were stupid.

419
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,819
Hey.

420
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,779
Hey, these drinks don't involve games,

421
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,440
or organised fun, do they?

422
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:44,441
Erm, it's pretty chill.

423
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,519
Chilled works.

424
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,900
Okay, I'll get the...

425
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,280
Hello?

426
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,530
Hello?

427
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,340
Kenny?

428
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,780
Hello?

429
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,429
Hi. This is Kenny. Leave a message.

430
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:14,361
Hey. Erm, I'm here.

431
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:16,179
Oh, I think I have your phone.

432
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,429
Where are you?
